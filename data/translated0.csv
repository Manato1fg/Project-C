"Some may say that the boy has been socially sanctioned enough, that Sushiro's later response was too excessive, etc., but the general public that was shown such a video is sickened and angry. That's definitely reduced the number of people going to Sushiro. Are social sanctions sufficient? Not at all. Is Sushiro overreacting? If they hadn't done that, the number of customers wouldn't have come back. Sushiro went that far, and that's why I felt relieved. I'm really angry at the people who are defending this boy.",1,1
"You asked for an explanation as to why it was necessary to replace all the soy sauce jugs. I have never worked in the Sushiro operation, so I do not know, but at other conveyor-belt sushi restaurants, the soy sauce jugs and ponzu and gari containers from all the tables were collected at closing time and stored in the refrigerator.All the gari were put back in the large container and the gari containers were cleaned daily.So, we cannot identify the soy sauce jug that was pranked, and in light of all the other factors, I believe that we had to replace all of the soy sauce jugs.",1,1
"I am not in the restaurant business, but I think the employees in the middle of such an uproar were worried that they would lose their jobs in the worst possible way. I am not in the restaurant business, but I am sure that the employees in the middle of such an uproar were tormented by the fear of losing their jobs.It is a stark fact that the collapse of a single business can destroy the lives of many people, and the consequences of the boy's actions could have caused that to happen.Even if it was someone else who spread the news, he was the one who did the annoying deed and posted it on the Internet with his friends.I am sorry for the family who suddenly found themselves in such a predicament, but it is out of line to criticize Sushiro's response as unmanageable.",1,1
"It is a judicial decision as to what amount of compensation will be the drop-off point, but the stock price has actually plummeted. It is true that what was permissible under the old values is no longer permissible today.This child's act is basically the same as graffiti or shoplifting during the Showa period, but the difference is that it spreads rapidly through the network.The damage caused by a single restaurant can spread to other restaurants throughout the country, from Hokkaido to Okinawa, due to safety standards. And as restaurant groups become larger, they must go public and raise funds for their operations, which will affect their stock prices.At one time, there was a story about how even a small shoplifting by a bookstore group could affect its operations. Parents should be aware that networks and economies are becoming larger and larger.",1,1
"If the number of visitors to the store has decreased since the news report, the impact of the boy is surely significant.The store needed to appeal that it was taking countermeasures, so it immediately did the ""replacement of all bottles"" thing.Frankly speaking, I think that 67 million yen is a very lenient bill.Including the actual damage, cost of countermeasures, personnel expenses, etc., I think it would not be surprising if they charged more than 10 times as much.",1,1
"The reason for the decision to discard and replace all the soy sauce bottles is because they decided that they could not regain their reputation for hygiene unless they replaced the bottles with new ones, rather than just washing them like hot water bottles. Why should the victim have to think about this or that, even considering the perpetrator's pocketbook?I think 67 million is a very generous amount considering the number of stores. Even if the amount was increased by about 90 million, it would still be a huge loss for the overhead each store would have to spend to make sure customers trust their hygiene practices.The cost of losing the trust of any customer is huge.",1,1
"I think it is hard for the juvenile's lawyer too.They are defending people who are clearly at fault.However, it is that kind of work, so it can't be helped.Common sense has many definitions and interpretations that vary greatly from person to person, but that does not excuse all intentional, malicious, and negligent acts.Even if you act out of the goodness of your heart, you can still be charged with a crime.The rest is for the court to decide, so instead of getting all worked up about it after all this time, I would like to take a close look at the process and the results, and use them as a lesson to others.",1,1
"In a criminal case, the fact that the offender is a juvenile, has received social sanctions such as expulsion from school, and is remorseful may be a factor in reducing the sentence, but these factors are not relevant for civil damages. In addition, the fact that the child is a minor means that the parents are responsible for supervising the child, but I don't think this will affect the calculation of the amount of damages.　I think the only issue is to what extent a causal relationship should be recognized with regard to the amount of damages.　Since incidents like this are expected to occur in the future, I think it is necessary to take measures to prevent recurrence. I think we live in a world where it is no longer enough to say ""the customer is God"" or ""the customer is good. I think surveillance cameras and identification of customers are necessary.",1,1
"From the perspective of the emphasis on rehabilitation, the victim advocacy opinion arises. But you just don't have to do that in the first place. Bullying also occurs because we make the wrong decisions about what not to do. Bullying is also a crime. It is important to make people properly aware of their criminality.",1,1
"Many people may feel that we live in a world where the rights of the perpetrators of crimes, not just Mr. Sushiro's case, are strongly protected. The boy's expulsion from high school was the result of his own foolish act, and the financial damage and consumer distrust inflicted on Mr. Sushiro would be another perpetration. I would like to see him pay for his crime well to deter criminal behavior by minors who think they can be protected.",1,1
"The fact that the video went viral, that the boy was expelled, that all bottles were replaced, and that sales ultimately decreased are all events caused by the boy's actions.The fact that the video was spread is not Sushiro's fault. Therefore, if the boy wants to claim a reduction for that reason, he should sue the person who spread the video.If Sushiro had not taken measures such as replacing all bottles at that time, it would have suffered immeasurable damage.The customers would not have felt safe unless they had gone to such lengths.The decrease in sales can be easily seen by comparing the results before and after the video.If the company is not going to be remorseful and appeal to warm-heartedness, but is going to fight the case all the way, there may be an additional charge.",1,1
"I think those who say it's too harsh are lacking in ethics.If the restaurant had been closed because of this incident, the employees would have lost their jobs, if the boy had an infectious disease, it could have spread, and if overseas, it could have been considered an act of terrorism in the worst case scenario.",1,1
"They do not even understand how much damage can be done to companies by the videos they post in this age of social networking.If you have reached the age of adulthood, it will be recognized as a crime, and at the same time, you may be sued by the damaged company and asked to compensate for the damage.I have to say why they do this despite the fact that they are being educated in schools these days about how not to use social networking sites before they use them.I think they want to assert themselves, but I hope they will also use their wisdom to think about what to do afterwards.",1,1
"They may be doing the same thing to other stores and bottles, if not all bottles. The average customer would think so, and it would be difficult for the boy to prove that he did not do it to other bottles.If the boy says he only licked this bottle, who would trust him?Don't you understand that it is impossible for the boy's side to regain the trust of the general public, so Sushiro has no choice but to take action?I think Sushiro's response of replacing all bottles to protect food safety is correct and deserved. If they had responded half-heartedly, customers would not have returned and sales would have declined further. If that happened, I think the amount of damages would have increased.In fact, I think the boy should be grateful for Sushiro's response.",1,1
"It is common practice to replace all bottles. It may have been done often in various places before it became an incident, and there may have been people who imitated it before it became an uproar. Customers would not feel safe if they only had to deal with the perpetrator's seat in the affected store. Of course, the analogy must be applied in favor of the offender. In addition to this case, there have been cases in which sentences have been reduced in court on the grounds of ""social sanction,"" but I think this is something that should not be allowed to happen. Even if the case becomes known to the public and the perpetrator is disadvantaged or disgraced as a result, it should be ""self-inflicted"" and should not affect the trial. In addition, in Japan, the law is very lenient in cases where the perpetrator was young, citing rehabilitation and good character, etc. However, in cases where there is a victim, I would like to see the perpetrator make full reimbursement and full compensation to the victim the first priority. It is truly deplorable that the victims are left out of the loop, and the victims are left to cry themselves to sleep.",1,1
"When a food hygiene problem is discovered, it is the company's duty to identify and eliminate all causes.If a soy sauce jug is found to be unhygienic, all soy sauce jugs should be disinfected and the contents replaced. Sushiro is simply fulfilling its duty.Of course, the labor and raw material budget required to do so would be a loss to the company, so the claim for compensation would go to the perpetrator.Moreover, the perpetrator did it intentionally. If it is a mistake on the part of the company, the company is responsible, but if the assailant did it intentionally, it is a different story.Also, you say something about competing companies.......the same loss is suffered by the competing companies as well, because of what the perpetrator did. It's not just about conveyor-belt sushi...it's about the damage done to the image of the restaurant company. And let's not forget that it will take a tremendous amount of time and effort to wipe it out.When you don't even understand the gravity of the situation, you haven't acquired common sense.Ignorance is a sin.",1,1
"Those who defend the perpetrator must sincerely believe that the juvenile is remorseful and does not need to be further attacked. Therefore, they must be prepared to bear the 67 million yen (which is still a considerable reduction from the amount of damage) that the juvenile should have to bear themselves. If anyone defends the perpetrators in the future, why don't they say something like, ""I will shoulder the 67 million yen"" before defending them? That way, their seriousness will be conveyed.",1,1
"I believe that the relationship between a restaurant and its customers, not limited to restaurants, cannot exist without trust.This incident shook the customers' trust in Sushiro's hygiene management from the customers' point of view, as well as the customers' trust in Sushiro from the customers' point of view, who would not do such a thing if they thought it was common sense.Sushiro's resolute response has let us know that the customer is only a customer and never in a higher position.I hope that Sushiro will not compromise and will continue to work hard until the end. I will support them.",1,1
"I am not inclined to defend this boy at all.However, we have to separate the trial from the ethical issues.It is a fact that there are 50,000 matters in the world where there is a gap between trial and ethics, and trying to resolve all of them rationally would be crass.It is inevitable that the only thing that can be determined in a court of law is a definite and certain damage.I think the damage suffered by Sushiro in the real world is much more substantial, due in part to reputational damage.",1,1
"I don't know if the parents are saying that or he himself is saying that, but I feel [my senses] are numb. Most people would think that other soy sauce bottles might be licked after seeing that video, and companies should not be able to not take action unless there is zero chance.I hope I can put my mind to it and change my mind that it was my mistake to drop out of school or not be able to live a peaceful life and give myself a chance to change.It doesn't mean that my future life is pitch-black, such as how to attend high school again through correspondence or take a college entrance examination.You just have to brighten your future by yourself while sincerely making amends. Good luck.",1,1
"How much of a blow can the spread of a social networking site cause to a chain store? For example, if a chain store with 1,000 stores were to lose customers because of this, even if the cost per customer is estimated at 800 yen, the loss would be 800 yen x 1,000 stores, or 8 million yen. I know how lightly they went about it. I don't know how lightly they went about it, but it is very likely that the loss caused by it would not be contained in 100 million.",1,1
"I feel that the defense lawyers are handling the trial in their own vanity.I don't think this kind of response will benefit the juvenile side either.As for the impact on sales, ""the cause of the decline is competition,"" and as for the hygiene rumor problem, ""it is extremely subjective psychology of consumers,"" and the objection as to whether it was necessary to ""destroy all the bottles"" is relatively poor as a defense, as it will be subject to more public criticism.It is likely that the full amount of the claim will not be awarded.It is normal to formulate a defense policy focusing on the fact that the person has been socially sanctioned and is remorseful.If you claim that you were forced to drop out of high school and that you have suffered ""disruption of a peaceful life,"" you will only be accused of having done so.",1,1
"As an individual restaurant, it takes years or decades to increase the number of customers, but customer turnover is instantaneous in this industry. A chain restaurant supports the lives of a tremendous number of employees and their families.It is laughable that a student who has never worked in a restaurant would say why they replaced all the bottles. Food service is built on everyone's conscience and trust.Even if you didn't intend to spread the word, that's what social networking is for.",1,1
"What is the lawyer saying about him as his job?I think it is an understandable and natural decision to replace all bottles as a necessity to demonstrate sanitary control as a company.If the consumers are concerned about sanitation and sales have decreased due to subjective psychological concerns, then it is undeniable that the boy's actions may have had an impact on them.It would be ridiculous to ask the other company to bear a portion of the loss because he is living a life of remorse.It is a matter of human nature whether a person is remorseful or not, and it is only natural that he should compensate the company that caused the damage.There are other aspects I would like to go into, but I think there are no extenuating circumstances at all on the boy's side.",1,1
"I disagree with the opinion that Sushiro goes too far.Sushiro has gone to such lengths that everyone can rest assured. On the contrary, they should have charged him a much higher amount.I think it would be best if the juvenile side admits his guilt without any dispute, requests a reduction in the amount of the bill because he cannot pay it, and Sushiro agrees to settle the case with a substantial reduction.",1,1
"The person who did it can identify that seat, but the third party, the many other customers, cannot tell where it was done. It is natural for the restaurant to clear out the restaurant. Customers are discouraged from coming to the store until the rumors are quelled. The economic effect would be a stock market crash. Considering the damage, even 67 million yen is not much. You may think your action is small, but you should know that the impact on society is unimaginably large.",1,1
"People often say that a child is a juvenile or that it is a child's fault, but I don't think it is necessary to make a distinction between adults and children when it comes to responsibility. Under the current circumstances, children cannot be held responsible, so it is only natural that their parents should take responsibility. We should learn that freedom can only be achieved by fulfilling our duties and responsibilities.",1,1
"Personally, I think we can take a strong stand against Sushiro. As is the case in this matter, the penalty is vague, and if so, there is no choice but to appeal to the civil courts. The perpetrator complains that his peaceful life was threatened, but on the other hand, the company also says that it is no longer able to conduct its normal business. There are many people who defend the perpetrators because they are children or juveniles, but it is impossible for them to lead a peaceful life if they are unable to judge right from wrong without being pointed out.I hope this trial will lead to deterrence in the future, and I think it is necessary to legislate the punishment.",1,1
"I think it is dangerous to take the opinion of the juvenile's lawyer as if the juvenile and his family are saying it.I guess that's what lawyers are supposed to do, eh? I think they would talk about things that include ""What?I didn't think this compensation claim was against one boy.I was very surprised that it was not joint and several liability rather than advocacy.So if the claim is settled for a reasonable amount, that's why I think this boy's side should sue his friend who took and spread the photo.I think we should split the bill between this child, the photographer, and if there were others, they should be included and pay the bill.I don't agree that this child is the only one.I wonder how the friends who took the pictures and their parents feel about it.If only those who are filmed are sanctioned, then that kind of vicious harassment and bullying may occur in the future.",1,1
"Well, the juvenile's side has no other means of refuting this kind of sophistry. The lawyer in charge of the case may have thought that such a counterargument was theoretically valid, but he was not smart enough to take into account how public opinion would react to it.",1,1
"The claim for damages by Sushiro is a matter of course, so it would indeed be out of line to criticize it.Also, it is natural that the defendants are desperate because they would not be able to live, or at least their lives would be ruined, if they were obliged to pay 67 million yen or more in damages.In my layman's opinion, I feel that the point is probably that there was no intention to spread the news, and the boy will end up being liable for a very small portion of the damage Sushiro suffered.",1,1
"After this problem, my family members told me that they don't go to eat at kaiten-zushi because they feel sick. I feel that we are not the only ones who can no longer go there. I have a feeling that we are not the only ones who have stopped eating there, even in places and prefectures far away from the restaurant where the problem was reported. It is true that there are things that cannot be dispelled even if you look at the efforts of the companies. I hope you realize that the damage is not only to the companies, but also to the users who can no longer go to their favorite revolving restaurants.",1,1
"Certainly it is pitiful in the area of high school expulsion and a peaceful life.But it must be the person who did the behavior that caused it.Unless there was fraud or bullying and he was forced to do it, it sounds like a terrible excuse.I wonder how many sushi chains there are out there, even upscale ones. It is unacceptable for a company to take the risk of going out of business over an incident like this, and if I worked for Sushiro and had a family to support, I would not forgive this boy if there was bankruptcy or a decrease in pay.",1,1
"This case, in my mind, is not the same as the recent Marugame Noodles ""frogs mixed in with vegetables"" case.I have a completely different feeling about this.If it was a G, I would have a sense of resistance, but if it was a frog or a caterpillar, I would be able to get away with it because I feel safe in the knowledge that they are not covered in pesticides.But with frogs and caterpillars, I can just say, ""That can happen, can't it?However, I feel quite a bit of resistance to this scipero problem.I feel sickened first, and in case the company doesn't take proper action....I would still think, ""This just happened to be a hot topic, and other restaurants too?"" I would think to myself, ""This is just a topic that happened to come up.I would think, ""This just happened to be a topic of conversation, and other shops are also doing this?Even if this kind of thing becomes a topic of conversation frequently, if they take an oddly tolerant attitudeIf they are tolerant of such a situation, it may be more than just saliva contamination.I want them to put a stop to it somewhere.Otherwise, I will be reluctant to eat any of the condiments on the table. I would be turned away.I think it's fine for those who think that if they care about such things....I think it's a good idea.",1,1
"I think the most important thing is the deterrence of recidivism above all else, rather than the equivalent amount of damage on the part of the store or business.It all started with the boy's act, and I think the act of spreading the disease is what ultimately prevented the worst of the actual damage.And the cost of the measures taken to protect the consumer is a reasonable charge.I don't know what the actual outcome will be, but I hope there will be no extenuating circumstances, no reduction in compensation, and no compassion for the foolishness of the risk factor caused by the negligence of the parents. Not all children are our hope for the future.",1,1
"Conveyor-belt sushi is a business that is built on a relationship of trust with customers. The boy's actions in this case only destroyed that relationship of trust, and I think it is fair to say that it damaged not only Sushiro, but the conveyor-belt sushi industry as a whole. The boy's act has caused a damage not only to Sushiro but also to the conveyor-belt sushi industry. In fact, I have not been going to Kaiten Sushi for a long time because I don't feel like going to Kaiten Sushi. In the first place, they say they don't anticipate it being spread, but it's like saying it doesn't matter if they commit a crime as long as they don't get caught. I still don't think they understand how much they have done something they shouldn't have done.",1,1
"The juvenile's lawyer must be working frantically.However, the corporate side needs to take a firm stand. As a company that provides shareholders, employees, and customers with a safe and secure place to eat, I hope the company will take a firm stand.This is an extremely malicious case that requires no concession on the part of the company.The decision of the Japanese judiciary will be closely watched.",1,1
"Perhaps this is par for the course in the world of lawyers, but I am curious about the phrase ""seeking an explanation"". An ""explanation"" is in response to a misunderstanding or accusation, and no one thinks that Sushiro's side is in such a position. I believe the correct phrase is ""seek clarification."" As a lawyer, you may have made a verbal attack to score points, but I think it is a bad move to harden public opinion. The amount of damages is customarily reduced in many cases, but 67 million is not an amount that cannot be paid, and even if the amount is reduced, I think that if it is less than 50 million, the case will be contested again. Also, if the spread was not his intention, then it would make sense to sue his friends and influencers, and it is none of Sushiro's business.",1,1
"If you are going to condemn the replacement of all bottles, you should be able to provide proof that you can distinguish the Pero Pero bottles from the safe bottles when you upload the video.Not only restaurants, but any business that is built on trust, if a restaurant intentionally commits an act that could damage that trust, shouldn't it be a matter of course that it bears the necessary expenses to restore trust once negligence or intentionality is recognized?",1,1
"I would like to see the juvenile's lawyer also disclose his real name, what kind of trial he was involved in, and what statements he made. If they can be confident in what they say now, there should be no problem. How society will judge you is another matter. I think the more you defend this case, the more you argue against it, the more severe the punishment sentiment will be in society.",1,1
"Even if Sushiro is not considered to be entirely responsible for the drop in stock price and sales, I think it is socially acceptable to assume that it has had more than enough impact to make the world go along with it. It is a clear fact that without the video posted by the boy, the impact would not have been as great as it was.Moreover, the identification of the boy was not a response on Sushiro's part, and Sushiro does not bear any guarantee for the boy's future.Considering all of this, I don't think there is room to accept all of the boy's claims.",1,1
"In the restaurant business, trust and security affect the number of customers. For example, if a celebrity is reported for adultery or drugs, advertisements, sponsors, and dramas will be affected, as well as past works. The firm, the person himself/herself, and others are held liable for damages. In this case, the boy was a party to the incident, which was widely reported on the Internet and on TV, so it is only natural that Sushiro would take appropriate measures and charge the boy for the cost to prevent future damage.",1,1
"For Sushiro's part, a claim for damages is necessary to fulfill its accountability to shareholders. Japanese society is changing, and I believe that a casual settlement is no longer enough. Although a settlement will be reached in the end, the boy's lawyers should prepare to sue the influencers who spread the video without the boy's consent. I think it is better to settle everything in court.",1,1
"This time, I think it is a trend to create a form to show that there will be such severe sanctions if a similar case should occur in the future.As for the bottle replacement, the provider has to give the customers absolute peace of mind, so they have to adopt a policy that gives the users peace of mind rather than vague measures.Of course, the decrease in sales may not be entirely due to this incident, but it is certain that it would not have decreased without it, and it is possible that the synergistic effect is lower than it should be.This may sound harsh, but in this case, parents and other adults around them are also to blame.Children grow up watching their parents' backs, and it is true that many parents today do not have the time to spend with their children, but parents are the only ones who can formulate what is good and what is bad in their children from a young age.However, parents are the only ones who can formulate ""what is good and what is bad"" in their children from a young age. If they are not scolded, they will not be able to understand that it is wrong.",1,1
"Since the incident, people who used to enjoy going to conveyor-belt sushi restaurants have stopped going, or have refrained from going even though they would like to, because the memory of the incident is so strong. I think the question of why they are replacing the bottles in all the restaurants may arise because they don't have the brains to even imagine such a situation.",1,1
"As a customer, I am concerned about the safety and security of restaurants, so if something happens at one restaurant, the attitude of responding to all restaurants is worthy of recognition!I think you're right about replacing all the bottles.Sushiro also suffered a great deal of damage, and yet they are asking for an unbelievable amount of compensation, an amount that could be paid back by the family working, or by the boy working for the rest of his life.And yet, the lawyers had nowhere else to go to defend themselves?I think Sushiro is thinking ahead, so if they don't settle the case while the amount is small, they'll come up with a lot more later on.",1,1
"The boy needs to be punished to the point that he will never recover.The world is not as sweet as the boy and his family think it is.The boy has become famous, for better or worse, and he should use that to his advantage and start something to make money.It will take time, but he has to build it up one staircase at a time.He should do this on his own, without any help.Of course, you must always show that you are sorry.",1,1
"If you say that the decline in sales is a competitive factor, then who caused the customers to go to that competitor, which is not a very emotionally acceptable story.Well, as one would expect, the claimants must have some supporting data to back up their claims, and since the causes of sales decline are always complex, it is difficult for the claimants to specify ""this is it,"" so it would not be surprising if the claim is accepted to some extent and the amount is reduced from the amount claimed.However, I think the replacement of the bottle is an acceptable response in general, and the fact that the victim was forced to drop out of school and that his/her daily life became difficult is nothing more than a reflection of his/her own guilt. But if the offending party insists on it, it looks like, ""Hey, you don't feel sorry, do you?In any case, the victim cannot pay the debt, and the whole family will have to bear it, so it is understandable that the victim resists desperately.",1,1
"It is a harsh price to pay for mischief. However, it would be strange if the party who suffered damage had to endure it in silence, and as long as it is clearly a criminal act, I think a claim for damage is justified. Even if the deterrent effect is not directly related to the Sushi Pero boy, I feel sorry for him because he is old enough to judge right from wrong and did it knowing that it was a nuisance, but more than that, I think the person who was inconvenienced should be protected.",1,1
"Personally, I think it is right to punish them severely.I believe this is a major problem that undermines corporate efforts based on morals, safety, and also cosmetics, not only in the conveyor-belt sushi industry, but in the entire restaurant industry.It is true that there may have been other perpetrators of this kind of behavior in the past. However, the responsibility for spreading this information and for making it develop into a social problem is significant.If we take into account the shocking counterargument in the text, I think it would be better to limit the amount of damages from the replacement of all bottles to only the replacement of this store, and to the amount of damages from the sharp drop in the stock price in a short period of time, taking into account the competitive factors.Certainly, we are in an industry where we are competing with our competitors, but I feel that the stock price plunge in such a short period of time tells us that this was a factor.Why did Sushiro replace all bottles? It was to regain consumer confidence. You get the idea.That would definitely amount to hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. 。。。。。",1,1
"Sushiro has also been forced to take measures to prevent share price decline and sanitation due to that video.Many of the top shareholders of this company are institutional investors and so-called funds.As there are many shareholders who have a say in fund-related matters, if the management does not file a lawsuit against the shareholders, there is a risk that the shareholders will file a representative suit against the management and a motion to have the management step down at the general shareholders' meeting.In the past, Japanese shareholders were mainly banks and life insurance companies, which was a good thing in some respects, but since the collapse of the bubble economy, the number of shareholders such as foreign funds has been increasing, and considering shareholder countermeasures, it will be necessary to file lawsuits against such mischief.I think the media should think about how to report the news.",1,1
"Personally, I think Sushiro's response is reasonable and the damages are on the low side. I feel that most people think so. However, the difficulty is that whether the damages are high or low is only subjective to us amateurs, and I get the feeling that the public (amateurs) are claiming that they are too low based on their emotions. In this sense, I think we have to leave it to the judiciary to make a proper decision.",1,1
"Every time I go to Sushiro,I get nervous if it's okay,The bottled soy sauce,I don't want to use the bottled soy sauce because of the video of them licking it.And to be honest, it's not just them,It's not just Sushiro's problem.I've seen a lot of people who don't mind touching the mouth of soy sauce, sauce, etc.I've seen a few people who touch them without a care in the world.So, please don't use bottled soy sauce or other common items.If you are going to allow customers to touch chopsticks and other items as they please, please make them in plastic bags, and tea in individual bags.",1,1
There is no need to defend the boy in this case. The fact that he was defended here will let society know that he would be defended even if he had committed a bigger and more life-threatening incident. He also needs to pay the compensation and realize the gravity of his crime.,1,1
"He denies any connection to the juvenile's conduct and asks that the claim be dismissed, saying ""the proliferation was not anticipated,"" ""the cause of the decline was competition,"" and ""the extremely subjective psychology of the consumer.""Lawyer, that's a top-heavy defense.A high school student should know that posting on social networking sites has the possibility of spreading, and from the sales before and after, sales clearly decreased after the social networking postings.He was also expelled from school.There are correspondence high schools in the city if you want to continue your studies, and you can even go to college if you are diligent.If he is sorry for his actions, he needs to be honest with the victim companies.",1,1
"He did not intend to spread the video and it is not his fault. If the boy's intention was to spread the video, then the boy's side should sue the person who spread the video. Sushiro is not responsible for that.Why did they replace all the shared containers?This is a measure that must be taken to provide peace of mind to customers all over the country who imagine that such insane customers may be scattered all over the country since the Peropero video has spread.Unless we accept full compensation for the damages.""I am sorry.""I am not ""remorseful"" if I do not accept full compensation for damages. And I think as a customer who uses Sushiro.",1,1
"The boy may be saying that due to various things such as declining sales, etc., from lawyers and others, but this is a very large Sushiro company. I'm sure they set the amount of damages after calculating various things. And although some may say that the social sanction has been done, such as being expelled from school, it has not been done, which is why they are going to court. I hope that this time, you will go to court firmly and show the resulting damages to the public, and that will be one of the deterrents.",1,1
"Sushiro's lawsuit for damages is a civil matter, so I don't think it has anything to do with the rehabilitation of the juvenile.Of course, Sushiro does not expect to get the full amount, but this case will come back to consumers in the form of higher restaurant costs. That is why everyone is so angry.The question is, if you honestly accept the boy's argument, would you want to hire someone who thinks this way? At the very least, I would be too scared to hire them. It may be a lawyer's courtroom tactic, but isn't this a choice that will further narrow the juvenile's future?",1,1
"That is how much Sushiro was doing business based on image alone.The items were not so different from those at other competing restaurants, but they were attracting customers through advertising.The other competing restaurants had always paid attention to hygiene. I think that was just the difference between the two.Maybe it was not by chance that Peropero Boy appeared at Sushiro, but it was an easy place to do it.That makes me think that Sushiro had something to take into consideration as well.",1,1
"It is understandable and natural that his legal team will try to get the court to grant him extenuating circumstances with as much favorable information for him as possible. However, the Sushiro case is being watched with great interest by the entire nation. It was a case of terrorism against an ordinary citizen, who could have been a victim at any moment. Therefore, the will of many people to have the ""culprit"" punished is very strong. I think this is the reason why there is little anger among the public, even though Sushiro has recently raised the amount of compensation despite the high cost of ""stamps"" for the lawsuit. I hope that the lawyers will take measures to avoid further antagonism between Sushiro and the Japanese people.",1,1
"Sushiro has nothing to do with the high school dropout or the disruption of his peaceful life...The boy should upload the video and bring a case against those who copied it without permission or stole it without permission.I sincerely apologize to Sushiro. He should also file a lawsuit for damages against the people who uploaded the videos without permission and made it impossible for him to lead a ""quiet life"". And then use that to compensate Sushiro for the damages.Then the restaurants would have a check against the nuisance customers. And the people who are bothered by unauthorized uploads will know that they can make amends to those people. Two birds with one stone, don't you think? And by the way, they would be able to pay for the damages without any difficulty.",1,1
"The other day, I visited a medium-quality restaurant for the first time in a long time, but the order was placed only on a touch panel and the goods were delivered by hand. Maybe it was because I am not used to it, but it was somewhat tasteless. I don't know if this is a good system considering the freshness of the products, and it may even prevent pranks, but I am a little sad because I no longer have the pleasure of waiting with anticipation for the actual products to come around the lanes.I hope that when the offenders like the ones who caused all the commotion are gone and safety is confirmed, they will go back to using both the lanes and the touch panel as they did before.",1,1
"These things aren't just temporary.For a restaurant, ""image"" is also important.After an incident like this, even if customers sit down at their table, they will be permanently worried, wondering if the restaurant is safe. Or someone might have licked this soy sauce jug or these disposable chopsticks..."" This is a permanent concern for the customers.Similarly with other crimes, for example, if a person is caught for assault or injury, people around him or her will be unable to get rid of the image that ""if I have anything to do with this person, I might get punched"".As for restaurants, that's just the damage.If you lose a few customers per restaurant, how much damage can you do in a year?Considering that, I don't think the restaurant's response this time was excessive.I hope other restaurants will follow suit in order to deter such stupid incidents that occur on a regular basis.",1,1
"I think it's hard to think of any competition.I went there for lunch a while after this, but there was no one there.The moment I entered the restaurant, I was like, ""What? I was like, ""What?It's hard to imagine that the competition alone is the only reason why the restaurant is empty at lunchtime, even on a weekday.We've been competing with each other for a long time.I think it's clearly due to the riot.I think it was necessary to do this in all stores as a measure for food safety and security.",1,1
"The restaurant industry suffered from the same level of alarm as the new Corona, in terms of stock price and customer traffic, and as a gold sign, it was not just tarnished, but physically spat upon, so the damage was enormous. The damaged company was only able to escape bankruptcy through its own efforts, but a single misstep could have resulted in the end of its business. If all of the employees had to relearn one or two skills as an immediate response, and if all of the hours for countermeasures, all of the voluntary overtime work, and the utility costs for such work were converted and added up for all of the employees, the total would have easily exceeded 600 million yen and 700 million yen. (Even so, the trial would be concluded at around 10% of the total, and since they would not be able to pay the bill, they would probably cry themselves to sleep.) If you factor in the hostility and redeem the money, you can claim 6 billion yen or 7 billion yen, and there are reports of such amounts overseas. But they didn't, and only sued for about 1/100th of the amount. That's a great warm-heartedness. They may be grateful, but there can be no counterattack. Can he be rehabilitated?",1,1
"The information society of today via SNS has transformed into a society where conventional ways of thinking are no longer acceptable, and individuals should naturally take responsibility for the fact that their actions can cause major problems and losses in society. The adults who are pretending to do so should also be aware of this. Rather than being manipulated by lawyers' tricks, juveniles should face up to the crimes they have committed.",1,1
"The replacement of all bottles would be the result of anticipated consumer sentiment. The company probably did this to dispel the fear of what consumers would think when they see this incident, and to dispel the fear that the bottles they will be using (or have used) may also be ..... What would consumers think when they see this case?Surely from a defense lawyer's point of view, is this necessary? But from the standpoint of Sushiro's management, I would say that it is necessary to dispel any small concerns.The reason for the large amount of compensation is, as we all understand, to prevent copycats.It's not Sushiro versus the boys, so to speak.It would not be an exaggeration to say that it is a bet on the credibility of the sushi world!",1,1
"Even if the decline in sales is due to a competitor's restaurant, the temporary stock price plunge is undoubtedly caused by the boy, and if the company is punished leniently here, it will affect the credibility of the entire restaurant industry in the future.",1,1
"A local yakiniku restaurant with several private rooms has changed from having condiments on the table to having them on small plates for customers to order after the Sushi-Pero incident. A private Chinese restaurant with private rooms now brings sauce and other condiments in small plates with the food, and if there is not enough, it is ordered.I know it was partly out of concern for the customers' eyes, but if they did that at my place, we would go out of business before we could even say we were liable for compensation. And since it's basically the same people who come here, all we can do is cry ourselves to sleep. It's a hassle and it takes a lot of time and effort, but we'll take measures. He said.The perpetrators of the Sushi-Pero incident should also think about the fact that there are a lot of restaurants in this world that have taken countermeasures in case they are held responsible for their own stupid actions.",1,1
"The article's ""nuisance"" of this time is not ""willing"" to be shared with many people through the Internet, and it also states that it ""does not expect it to spread.↓↓I think the very dangerous part is that they think they can do such a chest-thumping act if they don't spread it. The nuisances that are not spreading will not be limited to this. I hope you understand that this is a case that will be a blow to the restaurant industry itself!",1,1
"Even if the soy sauce bottles are properly cleaned and sanitized, some customers may feel uncomfortable with the same bottle of soy sauce, thinking, ""That's the bottle he licked....Of course, if the store is different, the bottle of soy sauce is different from the bottle that was used in the incident, but there may still be people who remember the incident and feel disgusted.Even if only one person in a million is disgusted by the soy sauce bottle, it is only natural for a restaurant business to replace it with a different design in order to get rid of such people.",1,1
"I think that discussing the appropriate size of a fine for a juvenile is not the same as discussing how the social infrastructure of restaurants, which have achieved low prices by letting customers do part of the operation based on the ethical conscience of customers, not just Sushiro, should be. I don't think it's a good idea to confuse the two, and I think it tends to make this Sushipero discussion futile.I think the part about replacing all the discarded soy sauce bottles is about the weakness of the infrastructure.If one person's immoral behavior is discovered, others must be suspicious, and the provider cannot always guarantee that it is hygienic, then the part about customers leaving because it is ""disgusting"" is a problem that the infrastructure has, which is what a lawyer who stands on the juvenile's side would have to say, and it is probably true. I think the way this article is written, trying to give a sense of the degree of remorse of the juvenile there, rather than what the juvenile or his parents muttered, is encouraging confusion by those who do not understand the legal approach.",1,1
"Ten years ago, back in the days of message boards and mixi, it would have been a specific local topic or issue, and the rumors would have ended up in a few neighborhoods at most.But nowadays, it can be viewed by the whole world immediately, and if sales decrease at a place like Sushiro, it will affect many people, so it is beyond the level where it can be lightly passed off.The truth is, people who can't judge that shouldn't be on social networking sites, but I think it's difficult these days because there's no choice but to not let kids have cell phones in the ...... modern age.",1,1
"Whether the amount that constitutes the basis for the claim is reasonable or not cannot be answered without a detailed check of Sushiro's financial situation and stock price. On the other hand, as for the reasons that can be assumed, the first reason is absolutely that it is for shareholder measures. It is difficult to convince shareholders with a small settlement or claim amount as long as the stock price has fallen and the sales amount has dropped. Of course, they must not expect that the full amount of the claim will be approved. In the end, the company will record the possible damages regardless of the actual amount of damages, and in the end, the amount will be lowered because the settlement was made in accordance with the court's wishes. I think the scenario has already been constructed up to the excuse, ""We settled according to the court's wishes, so the amount went down.",1,1
"You should know how many people were inconvenienced by what you did.It is important to face up to it in order to prevent the same kind of nuisance behavior. If possible, I would also like to request that other companies besides Sushiro, such as Manekineko Karaoke and Hamasushi, take strict action against those who cause trouble.",1,1
"We think that replacing all the bottles is a matter of course because it is a matter of the store's credibility.The perpetrator says that the compensation is expensive, but the store's credibility is at stake for the entire store.It is not a problem that can be solved by laughing or apologizing.Didn't think it would go viral?When they were taking the video, they must have thought it would be posted on something by today's youth. It sounds like an excuse now that it has become a social problem that has been blamed for the fire and accusations.Please keep in mind that no matter how young they are, if they cause such a problem, their parents will be responsible.At the very least, I want them to understand the difference between what is good and what is bad.",1,1
"I feel that the government has not kept up with the advances made to social networking and other services. It has only been about 20 years since the spread of information through SNS began due to the rapid spread of cell phones.　The extent of damage caused by SNS, etc. has been extremely impactful compared to the time when the crimes of obstruction of business and damage to property were created. We urgently need to revise the law to meet the needs of the modern age; such crimes using social networking services should be severely punished. For this reason, I hope that this court decision will not be too harsh on the victim and too lenient on the perpetrator.　Also, for crimes committed by minors, the punishment should be much stricter than it is now, from the standpoint of protecting the victims.",1,1
"There are many others who are doing the same thing, as the video is spreading to others besides the boy.Since Sushiro failed to take measures to prevent the act, consumers were afraid that some people were doing it in all their stores.It seems to me that determining the amount of damage based on ""how much the video was spread"" rather than on the content of the act is not fair, as it gives a strong sense of guilt and showmanship.",1,1
"The crime committed would be obstruction of business, so that should be tried as a criminal offense.Since this is a civil case, it is only a question of how much financial loss Sushiro incurred and how much responsibility the boy has, which is neither good nor bad.First of all, I feel that the boy licked the soy sauce, and that Sushiro needed to take prompt action once it was discovered, and that all the soy sauce from all the tables in the restaurant had to be destroyed, is all on the boy's side.Then, what about the cause of the decline in customers? Whether or not it was due to the video can be roughly guessed by comparing the same month of the previous year or by comparing the restaurant with other companies. The most problematic issue is the extent of responsibility for the video, which the boy claims was spread contrary to his intentions. The influencers who spread it would not be responsible. But it is also true that if the video had not spread, the damage would not have been so great. I would very much like to see the lawyers on Sushiro's side do their best for the future, and by extension, for the entire restaurant industry.",1,1
"There is one area where I think many people may be mistaken.In this case, Sushiro is not seeking damages to ""punish the boy,"" but is literally suing the person who caused the damage that was inflicted for an unjustifiable reason.So in the extreme, ""the other party is remorseful"" or ""has already been socially sanctioned"" is not really relevant; the perspective is how much damage was caused by the actions of this other party. That is why I think the juvenile side has adopted the strategy of claiming that the claim is excessive because that damage is not all his fault.Children have always been immature, and even so, there have been times when children's actions have caused tremendous damage. In that sense, the case might be similar to the case where an express train stops because of a stone left on the tracks and JR is asked to reimburse the driver for the cost of the reimbursement.",1,1
"The total replacement is an unavoidable measure because there is a possibility that saliva may be on something other than the video. Is the lawyer an ignorant person who does not know the risk of saliva on food?In general, if the juvenile is truly remorseful, he or she should be willing to accept any punishment. If they do so, they will receive sympathy and support.",1,1
"The fact that you were expelled from school and that you are being charged a large amount of money for damages are all the result of your own actions, aren't they? I am sure you have no sense of guilt that you have committed such a serious crime. The other day, I went to a certain sushi restaurant and found a pack of ginger in addition to a case of ginger. It is a countermeasure, isn't it? I usually go there to eat, but naturally I wondered if someone had licked it. Even if he atones for his crime, this feeling will remain forever as an image of the restaurant that will never disappear. I think he should be punished severely.",1,1
"This is an important trial for shareholders affected by the stock price collapse due to such actions. The concern is ""intentional nuisance"" involving manipulation of the stock price. If known in advance, they can take advantage of stock price volatility to gain an unfair advantage. Companies need to take a firm stand against nuisance actions, and the market needs to accept them calmly.",1,1
"Sushiro doesn't want to take 67 million yen. They won't be able to pay it.It is one of the measures to prevent this from happening in the future, and they want to make a case that if you misbehave, they will charge you a hefty amount.Expulsion from high school or whatever has nothing to do with Sushiro.I don't think the main purpose is to make up for the damage, so Sushiro would have to be very forceful in their stance to fight the case.",1,1
"I hope that both sides will fight it out, no compromises, no settlements, etc. This is a must-see. It will be interesting to see if Sushiro will be fully recognized. Well, I think it would be a good precedent to prevent this from happening in the future, but there are points of contention. I think it is not a good idea to insist on replacing all the bottles, which is a common practice from other people's point of view.",1,1
"Sushiro deserves to be charged for the damage and the costs incurred in dealing with the situation, and I feel that the reason is because they have no intention of spreading the word, which is a theory that will not pass as long as the video was taken and posted on the internet.It may be that they have already received social sanctions, but I don't think this is a reason to drop or reduce the claim, as it has nothing to do with Sushiro.",1,1
"Frankly, I'd like to see someone who can argue that risk management, risk consulting, and other professionals who deal with companies in dealing with these types of cases, and who can argue that replacing only certain seating items is sufficient.No matter what the juvenile's lawyer claims, he/she will not be held responsible for the implementation of the plan, so anything said by someone who is not responsible for his/her own words will not carry any weight.The main purpose of the lawyer's side is to lower the amount of compensation to the company based on the boy's personal social sympathy, so his first priority is to impress the judge rather than social responsibility, isn't it?As a member of society, I think you need to take into account the prevention of future recurrence and economic loss when you make a statement.",1,1
"What is important is the deterrent effect of the monetary impact. Sushiro probably does not expect to get the full amount, and the amount actually approved by the court will probably be at least one order of magnitude lower, but at the very least, Sushiro will be disgraced by its shareholders if it does not do that much.For some reason, Yahoo! has been reporting a negative view of the court case as a deterrent to Sushiro's shareholders.It is a good thing that Sushiro was a major company this time, but there was a buckwheat noodle shop that was forced to close its doors about 10 years ago because of ""byte terror"". In some cases, it could have produced such an impact that it greatly affected people's lives.As an agent, it would be a natural course of action to fight with this kind of logic, but when I think back to the soba shop in the example, I also feel dismayed.It is not enough to say, ""Let's just tolerate the kid's mischief.",1,1
"It would have been better if they had not been harmed in the first place. The victim is costing you time and money for a mishap that has come down the pike, and if this is a company you run, it is also costing you loss of popularity and customers. Anyway, no matter what happens, the victim deserves to be protected. Not only this company, but I believe that compensation for damages = compensation for actual damages plus a fee in lieu of restitution for all the time and psychological burden caused by the harm caused. Again, the perpetrator should not have committed the assault in the first place. The perpetrator may think that the compensation is too big, but as I said, the victim has not benefited in the slightest from the compensation. In any case, you should not do anything that harms the victim.",1,1
"It is unusual to make a fuss as if a high bill has been decided when there is no verdict yet.I wonder if we will have to wait for the verdict.Maybe this will be the standard for how we deal with this kind of nuisance in the future.When you take the life of a young child in a car accident, you can be charged a ruinous amount of compensation.Because we can assume that they will earn that much?It is not assumed that the child will not work.Why should a negative factor be employed in the sales assumption?If the company went bankrupt as a result of this incident, would they be compensated in full?How many bottles did the perpetrator do the same thing to in order to replace all bottles? How many bottles did the perpetrator do the same thing to? Therefore, I think that replacing all the bottles is the only way to avoid such a possibility.",1,1
"If the bottle had not been changed, it would have caused more damage to Sushiro.The competition factor was before this one happened, not after it happened, and has nothing to do with the steep drop-off after it occurred. Besides, they were the ones who diverted customers to that competitor.If Sushiro's reputation was not affected, then they should at least bear the cost of all the measures they took to curb that decline in reputation.",1,1
"It is probably true that the number of customers has decreased since the problematic video became a hot topic. This is because more and more people, not only those in the same store, thought that it might be dangerous. However, if the video had not gone viral, people would have been able to enjoy their time there without knowing about it. The store would not have suffered any damage, but for the consumer, was that good or bad? In other words, the stores were forced to take measures, but as to whether they were unnecessary measures, I can't say.",1,1
"I think the lawyer who took this case also regrets taking it now.Anyway, all I can say is that the site of the boy's act was not a ""privately owned sushi restaurant,"" but a ""restaurant of a company that operates a chain of sushi restaurants in Japan and abroad.but a restaurant of a company which has a chain of restaurants in Japan and abroad.I, too, feel hesitant to go out to eat these days.It is assumed that there are ""a great many"" other people who had such feelings.The damage by itself would be enormous, and if we consider the damage caused by the decline in the stock price of the company in question, etc., the impact would be even greater.The boy is now feeling sorry for what he has done.I don't think it is possible to just say, ""Well, the boy is sorry for what he did, and he is an adult..."".I think this is something that the perpetrators (the boy, his guardians, and his lawyer?) cannot even begin to imagine. The perpetrators (juveniles, guardians, and lawyers?) are out of the realm of the imagination.I think the perpetrators (juveniles, guardians, and lawyers?) are not in the realm of imagination, and are probably making ""mocking"" arguments that are off the mark.",1,1
"This case is part of the social changes surrounding the social problem.Aggravated driving has become a social problem, and after the severe punishment, it has been widely publicized and has had a deterrent effect to some extent.I believe that the series of food and beverage service terrorism cases will also become a social problem, which will lead to harsher penalties, and will have a deterrent effect as society becomes more aware of the issue.　Especially since the restaurant industry has been in a severe environment since Corona, this should be done without hesitation in order to protect the industry.The next most likely to come to our attention will be the ""shooters"".",1,1
"I always think of this article, but I don't understand those who defend the perpetrators or those who write the article.I feel that Sushiro is being kind to take measures to prevent this from happening in the future in all of its stores, and considering the costs, the amount of money spent is only this small.I hope that the family of the perpetrator will make amends and pay Sushiro for the rest of their lives.I hope that no one has been forced to quit their job at Sushiro because of this and that no one has lost their job because of the labor cost reductions.",1,1
"I think those who defend the perpetrators are underestimating these incidents and the damage they do, and what would happen if they did this kind of thing in their own business? I don't think they can imagine how realistic it would be if someone did this kind of thing to their business.I think they should be made to pay what seems like a large amount of compensation, even if it means putting them and their parents in debt, in order to prevent this kind of incident from happening again, and the impact it will have on society in the future.",1,1
"The equipment is used by others.If the boy licked the same shape of the equipment, it would be a very damaging act to the brand image of the entire store. We are not replacing them because they were actually harmful. We cleaned them from one side to the other to dispel rumors.I'm very concerned if they do this. We trust our customers and ask them to ""freely"" use soy sauce, wasabi, and chopsticks, but from now on, it will be very difficult for them to do this. This is a very easy thing to do and a very harmful act that caused a lot of damage. It is not too much to ask for compensation.",1,1
"Even though it is the lawyer's job to point out every possible point in order to lighten the sentence,Replacing all the bottles is too much. If you think that it was saliva this time, it could have been corona or some other disease,If not a pathogen, it could have been saliva with allergens such as egg, wheat, or milk.I think it's normal to be concerned about more than one possibility.If it was a drug (even if it wasn't a deleterious one), the same all-over replacement would be too much. I'm sure the other ones are absolutely fine. I don't know.From an allergic person's point of view, saliva and drugs are no different.",1,1
"I don't think they are remorseful for causing this kind of incident to happen and refuting it. Not only Sushiro, but many other restaurants have soy sauce and other condiments on their seats. Until this incident, I didn't think there were people who would lick soy sauce bottles at restaurants, but after this incident, I think many people are a little concerned about whether soy sauce bottles are safe at this restaurant. But after this incident, I think many people have become a little concerned about the safety of soy sauce bottles in restaurants. I think a restaurant is not only a place of taste, but also a place that cannot survive if its safety is threatened. In that sense, as long as there are a certain number of people who have no common sense, we need to let them know that they will be charged a large amount of compensation if they cause such an incident. This will serve as a deterrent. I think Sushiro filed the lawsuit not only to protect its own group, but also the restaurant industry.",1,1
"You should know how society works, you should try working for this company, you can understand how much this act has affected you, even a little, you should know the other side, you should know the other side, there are more and more people who simply do not think deeply about things, and their parents are not educating them. What will you do, how can you take responsibility for this act, will you take it, please think again.",1,1
"In fact, I haven't been to Sushiro since I saw this boy's video. I have removed it as an option, like I want to go to Kaiten Sushi -> let's try something other than Sushiro -> I'll go to Kura Sushi.The nearest conveyor belt sushi restaurant from my house is Sushiro, but Sushiro probably reminds me of the video and makes me sick even when I eat there. I think there are other people like this, and I think the damage is not only the cost of replacing all the equipment, but the damage is not that much when you consider the secondary damage, I wouldn't be surprised if they charge 10 times as much.",1,1
"In Japan, the concept of punitive damages basically does not exist, and damages are awarded only to the extent that a direct causal relationship is recognized.On the premise that there is no direct causal relationship based on the subjective psychology of consumers, a causal relationship is considered to exist if it is considered that this is how consumers would perceive the product, and a causal relationship is denied if they would not normally think of it that way.As for the impact on sales, unless the defendant can specifically prove that it was caused by other factors, it will probably be recognized as damage.Also, the spread on social networking sites was unintentional, but this argument is not valid.(It is ignorant to say that the defendant did not think of the possibility of spreading the information after posting it on social networking sites, and this is a problem before awareness.)(The fact that Sushiro was socially bashed is not the same as the harm suffered by Sushiro, so it is not a circumstance that will be considered in this case.However, bashing itself is basically out.",1,1
"If the current system has the potential to cause 60 million in damages, then efforts on the part of companies to improve it will be required of shareholders. Condiments, chopsticks, and other items that are touched by an unspecified number of customers will not be allowed on the table, and the system that supports Japan's inexpensive restaurant culture will have to be rethought.",1,1
"He claims that the problem is not the fact that he spread the information, but the problem is that he pranked people, and that he is sorry for what he has done. But just because they are sorry does not mean that what they did will disappear or end. The people who are supporting them are the victims. The company is obligated to protect the lives of its employees, and this incident has increased the amount of work that they did not have to do, and they do not realize how many people they have inconvenienced. Other annoying YouTubers and others should be sued and made an example of. That if you inconvenience people, you have to pay for it.",1,1
"In addition to the direct damage caused by the licking of the soy sauce bottle and teacup between the boy and the Sushiro restaurant in question, the impact on all Sushiro restaurants, the conveyor-belt sushi industry, and the restaurant industry as a whole, as a result of the spread of the video triggered by this incident, is quite significant in that it threatened consumer safety and security.The impact on the restaurant industry and the general public is immeasurable.The amount of compensation should be carefully calculated, disputed, and determined by the parties involved.On the other hand, the criticisms, abusive language, and direct annoyances directed at the boy by the general public were extremely severe and extreme, and I think it is immature for society to take the stance that the boy is at fault and should accept whatever anyone says to him.People who were not greatly affected by the situation could easily trample on their lives with their own faces.This is not a new phenomenon, but I feel that the state of our society is a major issue facing Japan and something that each and every one of us should take a fresh look at.",1,1
"It is strange that the uploader and spreader of the video was not charged with any crime in the first place.At the very least, the uploader had the option of quietly telling the perpetrator, Sushiro, and not uploading the video to the Internet.Why didn't he do so?The reason is obvious.Because he wanted to have fun by making his videos go viral.Apparently, the current law says that it is safe to arouse mayhem for personal gain, but if that is the case, the rules are wrong.I sincerely hope that in the future this type of behavior will be penalized.",1,1
"Expulsion from high school"": the problem between the individual and the school. ""Disruption of peaceful life"" is the relationship between the person and the thing or person that is disrupting the person's peaceful life. The issue is whether the plaintiffs are pressuring the person and the school to ""drop out of school. I think the same applies to ""disruption."" The issue stems from the defendant's conduct. It is possible to assume that the annoying video makes the safety and security of the society unstable and causes inconvenience to consumers and stores, as well as criticism of the contributor.",1,1
"Is it something like there are situations where a crime is possible and there is blame? Like if you stab someone to death with a kitchen knife, is the knife maker at fault? That's not why we have kitchen knives. Whether it is a soy sauce jug or a teacup, it may have been in a situation where a crime could have been committed, but that does not mean it is okay to commit a crime. Because it's a miniskirt, it doesn't mean you can steal it. I feel that the compensation is not enough. I think it's just someone (I don't know if it's him or the people around him) who has no remorse and is getting carried away.",1,1
"Even if judged logically,Whether judged emotionally,You can't allow it to happen.Many people have become afraid not only of sushi, but of eating out itself.Besides, the company, the employees and their families, the suppliers, all concerned parties, and the shareholders would never forgive him.I think it would be best for this boy to spend his life to make amends.",1,1
"The ""because he is a boy"" that was acceptable a long time ago is no longer acceptable today. It has not been accepted in the general public for a long time.The only information that was sent out by the general public was not taken up by the media, and only the voices of communist-affiliated ""citizens' groups"" and the leftist media that took them into consideration were sent out under the editorial control of the media.Since the Japanese people are under strong pressure to conform, many people thought that the information transmitted by the mass media was the general opinion, and many people were really influenced by it.",1,1
"I think it was a good opportunity to learn the seriousness of ""keeping it on video.""It was a good opportunity to let people know the horror of the fact that the video is not just a one-time prank, but is recorded and stored as video evidence, and that it can still cause discomfort to viewers with vivid ""malicious and harmful intent,"" regardless of whether the person involved is sorry for the incident. In a sense, it is a ""historical"" event.",1,1
"The situation is developing in a way that fundamentally shakes the entire food and beverage industry's sexual morality. The very act of taking the action of filing a lawsuit is important, regardless of the price in monetary terms. If they are allowed to get away with it here, the perception that they will eventually be forgiven will spread, and there is a strong possibility that second and third acts of nuisance will emerge.The boy's side states that he did not post the video, but if that is the case, the boy or his lawyer should identify the owner who posted the video and file a lawsuit. Sushiro has incurred substantial losses, including reputational damage, so this is not the wrong course of action. The boy's licking of the soy sauce cup as a prank is an unthinkable thing in itself. Is it all right as long as he doesn't get caught? No, it is not.Bad things are bad no matter how old you are. It is only natural that they should be held socially responsible.",1,1
"If a food product is contaminated with a foreign substance, at the very least the lot is recalled and discarded, and sometimes the entire line or plant is recalled and discarded in consideration of the impact on consumers.Although it is impossible to make a comparison, simply replacing the affected bottles will surely draw away more customers than replacing all the bottles.It is difficult to identify the bottles after the fact, and it is impossible to be sure that the action was only one time when the video was taken.I don't think the all-bottle exchange is an overreaction.It may just be a claim that can be made since it is a court case.",1,1
"I'm sure the juvenile side was put in by the lawyer,""I am sorry. I'm sorry, and I've been socially sanctioned. That's all right, isn't it?""That's all right, isn't it?If they accept vague punishments such as social sanctions, there will be no more copycats,There will be no more copycats.The full amount would be unacceptable,A few million dollars, or an amount that can be repaid in about 10 years if they work hard, is not much of a deterrent.As an industry, making juveniles ""potential followers"" is a damage to their future,It is a damage to the future.Therefore, we need to let people know that ""a little game can become a life-ending nuisance.Public opinion is already getting tired of it.That's all he has done.This boy.But, ""Decreased sales are competition,"" ""Hygiene is a rumor,"" and so on,It was a wonderful fuel drop to the flame that was about to be extinguished.",1,1
"Why did they replace all the bottles?→The seat where this boy was sitting would have been identified, but since we can't rule out the possibility that the bottles were really from that seat or that he brought bottles from other seats, replacing all the bottles is not an option.There would have been some social sanctions, but no civil or criminal (well, not yet, since he is a minor this time) sanctions, so I feel it is normal to seek damages.",1,1
"It is unlikely that there will actually be a 67 million judgment, and I don't think Sushiro thinks there will be.Even 67 million is almost impossible for a boy who dropped out of high school and became a celebrity to pay off while he is still alive, considering the interest on the installments.The possibility of driving him to suicide or crime is not low, and he is afraid of image damage.Still, I think the only reason he is paying out 67 million is the utmost consideration for his shareholders.",1,1
"You can't say that it didn't affect the people working or part-time at Sushiro. It would have affected the customers quite a bit. In fact, there are fewer people who don't know about this incident.Those who think it was nothing more than a child's prank should think about how much this has affected society.",1,1
"Since he has drawn so much anger from the public, I think it would be better to show visible remorse by paying some amount of compensation.If it is only a few million yen, the identity of the boy's assailant has been exposed, and the netizens will be more aggressive.Lawyers should not only think about reducing the amount of compensation, but should also give top priority to suppressing the anger of the public, or the future of the boy will be at stake.I hope that they will realize that they have done that much.",1,1
"From Sushiro's side, 60 or 90 million yen is not much.Since Sushiro's consolidated operating profit last year was 10.1 billion yen, they did not file the lawsuit for damages.The main reason why they went to court was to show the public that this amount of damages can be claimed for nuisances and pranks, and to prevent similar nuisances from occurring in the future.If nothing is done and the case goes unnoticed, people may think that Sushiro is a bit of a jerk or that Sushiro can get away with a bit of mischief.If they think that, it could affect their customers' future visits to the restaurant.If they think, ""Sushiro is so lenient on nuisances that I can't eat at ease,"" they may think, ""Let's go to another restaurant. If they think, ""Sushiro is so lenient on nuisances, I can't eat at ease and will go to another restaurant,"" it will have a tremendous impact on sales.Sushiro had no choice but to file this lawsuit.They probably thought that crying themselves to sleep or neglecting the situation would have the most negative impact on future sales.",1,1
"I don't think it is necessary to defend something that has done wrong.Because you shouldn't have done it.Unless there is a reason you have to, you have to make amends for what you did.You seem to be saying that you don't need to replace all the soy sauce bottles, but you will if you deem it necessary to regain the trust of your customers.You say you are sorry and that you should drop out of school, but isn't remorse normal and dropping out of school is not an option?Even if he had no intention of spreading the information, he uploaded it to a social networking site where it would be viewed by a large number of people, so he must have foreseen that this would happen, and he should be punished.What is left to be seen is what kind of verdict will be issued.",1,1
"The expulsion from high school and the decline in the quality of life were self-inflicted, not the influence exerted by Sushiro. If he is remorseful, he should acknowledge and accept Sushiro's arguments as soon as possible and deal with the situation solemnly and with remorse. Only then will there be the approval and support of many people, and they should consider correspondence or night high school. If you enroll and don't study, you will again be a nuisance to other students, and I suggest you don't do it.",1,1
"I don't know why you are defending him now. I think the lawyer's argument at the trial was well thought out, but I can't help but think it's laughable for a lawyer to claim that the victim has received enough social sanctions for the consequences he or she deserved, or to try to reduce the damages to zero by almost flirting with the reason for the damage.I think that by always taking the perpetrator's advantage at times like this, people come to think lightly, as if they can handle it even if it becomes a big deal.If you want to call it a social sanction, you should make the person who took the video and shared it in a funny way bear the burden, not just one boy.I think that the defense for the perpetrator should be to show the way to make him reflect and make efforts to rehabilitate himself, rather than forcing him to eliminate the wrongs he has done.",1,1
"No, no, no. With this Corona disaster, companies that have been crying themselves to sleep are finally taking action. I don't think 67 million yen will be settled in a civil case, but it should be known how much damage it has caused.Some may ask, ""Why replace the other stores as well? I know some of you may think so, but I too stopped going to Sushiro and other restaurants because of this incident. I think this is what customers want.",1,1
"If you don't understand the damage you have caused, then you are not properly remorseful.This is a civil trial, so there is no discussion of extenuating circumstances, but even Akindo Sushiro would not want to settle with someone who is not properly remorseful.The fact that the victim is a ""big company"" is not a reason to ""forgive them.However, in the case of Japan, it would be meaningful to have the strength to complete a lawsuit for damages, which tends to end in futility even if the case is won.No matter how many people who are fully aware of other people's affairs defend the boy, I hope that Mr. Sushiro will not relent until the case is settled.",1,1
"I hope those who are defending Sushiro are thinking for themselves, and not for Sushiro. This case has the attention of all companies that provide food and beverage services.",1,1
"It doesn't matter whether you anticipated or not that the video would be spread. Rather, as a user, I am grateful that the spread of the video has made it known to the public that something like this incident actually occurs, and that the restaurant can now take preventive measures against it.The amount of damages is said to be a little less than 70 million yen, but I think the damage Sushiro has suffered will probably not end there. I don't think the amount of money could be repaid even if people worked all their lives.I can only think that we should be thankful that the damage was only this small and continue to pay it back for the rest of our lives.",1,1
"If you ask if all the soy sauce bottles had to be destroyed and replaced, you must understand that it was not necessary to do so for Perot, but it was necessary to do so in order to provide peace of mind to the customers.Some sushi restaurant workers may have lost their bonuses because of the loss of sales, and some may have been laid off.The overall damage is much greater than the boy's dropping out of high school.",1,1
"We need to find out who is the one to thoroughly defend the perpetrator against these things.The majority of people think (at least I do) that there should be proper sanctions against the perpetrators. This is because they know that this is not the only time this kind of behavior will continue, and that proper sanctions for those who do this will help curb it.This is why I can only assume that the advocates want to promote social unrest.Who wants to promote social unrest? Only those who would benefit from it.",1,1
"It is obvious that he posted it on social media in public because he wanted to increase the number of views of the video.And it is not a matter of reducing the sentence because he is a juvenile. If the sentence is reduced because he is a juvenile, I think the parents should be held responsible for protecting the minor for that amount.",1,1
"In Japan, the amount of compensation is ""a reasonable amount that can be repaid in one's lifetime,"" so this is the amount of compensation that the boy can claim. If public opinion hardens, the amount of compensation may increase even more, so the juvenile side needs to be careful not to argue too much.",1,1
"I think Sushiro's damages are justified.The appropriateness of the amount will be determined at trial.However, as for the point that they did not anticipate the spread of the tweet, I think it would be strange if they did not anticipate the worst case scenario of the tweet being spread as long as it was posted on the Internet.One tweet can get you kicked out of your job, so it's not like you couldn't have anticipated it.If it does not matter if it affects the consumer mindset, then it would be safe to spread unfounded bad news to make consumers leave and close down the store.I don't think it is too much to take away that they replaced all the fixtures to dispel the consumer mindset.It is a very motivating job for the lawyers.There are some things such as being forced to leave school and being prevented from leading a peaceful life, but this is exactly what he deserves, and it is caused by the relationship between society and the culprit, and from Sushiro's perspective, it would be a simple ""I don't know.",1,1
"Which family restaurants and other food service establishments has this boy been to in the past, and can he prove that he has never committed a mischief at one of those establishments? I think the story starts there.If true, he may have gone to other conveyor-belt sushi restaurants other than Sushiro and done it, so the bottle there must be replaced as well. You can't just do this once.",1,1
"Even though they are minors, high school students should be able to judge what is right and wrong to do, and if it is not spread, is it right? The various social sanctions resulting from the act could have been foreseen, and I think the amount of compensation for damages is low from Sushiro's point of view. There is no doubt that there are many other factors contributing to Sushiro's declining sales, but it is not something that the perpetrators should be proud to claim, and I don't think they are sorry for what they have done. What the perpetrator should do is to hold a press conference and sincerely apologize, don't you think? Then maybe Sushiro will agree to a settlement.",1,1
"If the defendants did not intend to spread the video, then they should sue the friend who took the video or let him join the lawsuit and give his opinion. Are you going to show the aesthetics of saying that you can't do it because he is your friend? I don't think it will lead to sympathy because it is in the bad boy's mind.The end result may be a settlement, but I think it is appropriate for the plaintiffs to seek a judicial decision because they are supposed to protect the interests of their shareholders.",1,1
"If the store is using the same items only after washing them, the impression of the store will surely be bad.For example, if you signed a contract for a new condominium but never used it, or if you signed a contract for a car but wanted to use a different car, the impression of the shop will certainly be bad.If you had a car delivered but never drove it, you would have to pay the same price.In general, it is difficult to maintain the same price and sell it.I think it is difficult to maintain the same price and sell it.",1,1
"If you make a nuisance of yourself to people or stores, you will be sanctioned. This is natural, isn't it?I have no idea how people defend the perpetrators. If the child cannot take responsibility, then the parents who could only discipline the child like that should take responsibility. Couldn't you have predicted the spread of the posted video? If you couldn't predict it, what does it matter what you do? That is exactly what I don't understand. If it is okay if you don't know or if the damage is small, doesn't that apply to all crimes as well? Minor or not, the crime should be atoned for. The amount of compensation is too small. I sincerely hope that the world will not become a place where people can be forgiven no matter what they do. I agree with Sushiro's response.",1,1
"If the case goes to an actual trial, representatives of both sides will properly plead their case.The justification for replacing the soy sauce would have to be a complete necessity, not a creed, to be admissible. The sales of the store could also be denied if it is the proliferation of the sales rather than the act of doing them. Justice is not always a full answer in court.It's like the hurdle that goes up when it comes to compensation for lost work time after an accident.However, regardless of the outcome of the trial, this amount of compensation will have a certain effect on future nuisances, because it also proves that the proliferation of this world has become inevitable.",1,1
"I would rather lick a jug of soy sauce that costs a few hundred yen a bottle,than breaking the windows of a school building at night,than breaking windowpanes in a school building at night.If it spreads, it is the end of the world. I say, ""Be imaginative.Synchronization is an impulse. There were and still are guys like that.But the results are different, so it can't be helped.The world may have become a suffocating place, but the times have changed.I feel sorry for them, but please listen to Yutaka Ozaki and try to grow up.",1,1
"What we need are numbers.Quantify how much damage has occurred.And not just quantify it, but it is essential to actually claim it as damage to the perpetrator.So Sushiro's response is not wrong.This should also apply to malicious shooters, for example.It's a conscious crime and there is substantial damage, you know? So, it is necessary to let people know that it is a conscious crime.Excessive is not the right word.",1,1
"For 16 billion in damages, less than 100 million is not worth it at all. Aside from the stock price, the loss and reputational damage to the stores that were the setting for the event should be paid at the very least. The damage to the entire chain of stores should be claimed separately, otherwise the landing point will be blurred and the amount of compensation will be small. Is that exactly what it's about? I don't think the breakdown is publicly disclosed. 100 million claim is indicated, but if Sushiro also does something wrong, the management team should of course compensate with their private funds.",1,1
"I think the amount of 67 million yen was a daring amount, knowing that it would be reduced in court. This is probably to deter such crimes from occurring in the future. I think the verdict will settle on an amount that an average family can adequately repay. The fact that the decline in sales is due to competition is not an exaggeration, since the damage is not limited to this one company, but extends to the entire conveyor-belt sushi and restaurant industry.",1,1
"It is inevitable that the defense attorney will raise the idea of detachment from the damage, even if only a little.However, it is not the same as agreeing with what it says and falsely accusing Mr. Sushiro of damages.You've mentioned things like excessive response regarding customer sentiment.Imagine and see if you agree with Mr. Sushiro's sentiments.You have been invited to a large sushi restaurant.There's a soy sauce spoon, a teacup, and some sushi that's been licked by someone else.This someone is a high school boy who is moving from one friend's house to another.Don't worry.One or two of each.Bon appétit.What do you think?I think we're getting off topic.I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",1,1
"The fact that it is a Corona disaster means that some of it cannot be dismissed as an underage prank.The spreading of the video is a secondary thing. The relationship between the boy and the friend who shot the video should be separated from the spreading of the video. I think we should separate the relationship between the boy and the friend who took the video from the spreading of the video. In the first place, they should have just not done such a thing. The resultant expulsion from school is another thing.Sushi culture is a symbolic aspect of Japan. It is only natural that any act that is tantamount to terrorism in terms of hygiene, including the handling of raw ingredients, should be dealt with harshly, regardless of age.",1,1
"It's not like they are thieves.The perpetrator's act is a challenge to the restaurant industry.Up until now, the restaurant has provided seasonings and other ingredients in that form because of the relationship of trust between the customer and the restaurant.If the restaurant cannot trust the customers, it is inevitable that they will change the system. As a customer, I would be skeptical and wonder if everything would be okay.In this sense, I think Sushiro's response is appropriate.",1,1
"First of all, considering the amount of compensation claimed, based on the damage sustained by Sushiro in the past year, the annual number of Sushiro customers in Japan alone is approximately 86 million, which means that the amount of compensation is less than one yen per customer. This is not high, but rather too low.The company probably lacks awareness of the fact that this is what it means to commit a crime with a large social impact.Next, let's look at the responsibility for this problem. Of course, the juvenile himself and those around him are responsible, but I would like to mention the left-wing media as well. The leftist media is to blame as well. In its coverage of the juvenile law, the media has been too protective of the perpetrators, and as a result, a tendency has emerged to allow this kind of open and honest behavior to continue.",1,1
"If we allow this to happen because he is a juvenile, other juveniles may take it as a wrong message that if they are young, they are allowed to do whatever they want.It may be hard on the boy and his family, but I think he should and must be punished.That goes for the person who took the video as well, and they should be held accountable for the same.",1,1
"First of all, don't make the mistake of thinking that, whether the video goes viral or not,I think the first thing that should not be misunderstood is that it would be wrong to peruse the video, regardless of whether it went viral or not.This perpetrator's argument could be taken as ""if the video had not gone viral, it would not have been a problem.The reason they replaced all the bottles was to regain the customers' trust, right?I don't think you can understand something as simple as that....However, I think it is also a problem if you don't listen to the assailant's side of the story at all,If there is any doubt, I don't think it is wrong to leave it to the court to make a decision.The reason he was expelled was because he had done something so serious,This has nothing to do with Sushiro...",1,1
"With Japanese morals in a nosedive, these problems should be dealt with severely to prevent them from happening again. These days, Japanese people have less respect for public places. That is why problems like this continue to occur. It is better to punish them severely to make them realize that if they don't respect public places, they don't belong there.",1,1
"Was it really only the soy sauce jug shown in the video? If the question arises, ""Wasn't that licked, too? If so, it would be a fair judgment on the part of the restaurant to replace all of the items. If so, it is a decent decision on the part of the restaurant to replace all of the food.I don't doubt that it is too severe for children, but the punishment for the same act should be the same, equality under the law.Is this within the scope of the Juvenile Law?It's a civil case, not a criminal one, and considering the damage done to the store and the company, it's probably a small price to pay.If the video had not gone viral and it was just one store, in the Showa era, he could have gotten away with a single fist bump and a dishonor, but now that it has gone public all over the world, there is nothing we can do about it.But now that it's out in the world, there's nothing we can do about it. Those who say that Sushiro's impression has deteriorated after seeing the amount of the bill, aren't their instincts a little off?",1,1
"Japanese law has not caught up with the times.I know it is difficult to judge accurately with the current laws.If more people continue to do what this boy did for fun, the restaurant industry will surely go under.If this happens, the damage will spread to the families of the employees of the company, subcontractors of major companies, logistics, and many other places.We need to make people understand that they are putting all of these people at risk.",1,1
"This child's actions have harmed not only Sushiro, but the conveyor-belt sushi and restaurant industry very extensively, and I would not be surprised if a large number of people other than Sushiro are demanding compensation for damages.In fact, all but Sushiro are probably crying themselves to sleep.I think we need to take firm action to ensure that this will never happen again.",1,1
"The fact that the perpetrators are still making statements to justify their criminal acts, such as ""Why did they replace all the bottles?"" and ""The decrease in sales is partly due to competition,"" suggests that they do not understand the gravity of the case, nor do they even reflect on their actions.I think such statements, which may be made by the perpetrator's lawyer, are counterproductive to the general public and to the companies that are the victims of the crime. It is too foolish. I hope that the punishment will be severe enough to deter future crimes.",1,1
"There is a problem with the original method of serving the product.The way in which one's ordered products are served to multiple customers without any protection.A company that has been piggybacking on the good nature of the Japanese people and has not responded in any way to predictable nuisances.To top it all off, they claim it is a business style that Japan should be proud of.Customers who believe that there are no people who misbehave with chopsticks and toothpicks that are always placed on the table under the guise of protecting forests.This is a case of congratulatory thinking that was bound to happen.The only way to serve food in a completely safe manner is at a high-class restaurant or ryotei.The price for safety is still a high price.How can you expect festival stalls and foreign food stalls to be safe and hygienic?Well, that is all left up to the restaurant.",1,1
"Well, in my personal opinion, if he talked so much about how sorry he is, I think it would be less damaging to him later if he accepted the punishment honestly without resisting or refuting it.If he had made a similar objection before the lawsuit was filed, but before the lawsuit was filed, he said he was sorry and that he had done a terrible thing, but after the lawsuit was filed, his objection would be seen as a mere apparent remorse aimed at reducing compensation.I also think it's wrong that he said something like, ""I didn't intend to spread the video.",1,1
"In a criminal trial, ""remorse"" and ""social sanctions"" would be considered extenuating circumstances, but in a civil trial, they would be irrelevant. I think you should be thankful that you only have to pay a civil penalty when you would have to pay a criminal penalty.",1,1
"In Japan, where public health is extremely strict, it is a matter of course for restaurants to disinfect and replace food at all locations to ensure the safety of customers.In this day and age, restaurants always operate with a sense of crisis, as if they were to lose credibility and go out of business immediately if a foreign substance is mixed in or food poisoning occurs, they would lose their credibility and go out of business.What was intended to be a minor prank has turned out to be an irreparable result.",1,1
"No need to relax the punishment. If we go in the direction of allowing this to happen, it will seriously undermine the safety credibility of the entire food and beverage industry, especially a business system like Sushiro's. This is something that must never be allowed to happen again, and if it does, it must be deterred by threatening to end one's life. If he wants to defend himself, he should just directly provide assistance to the perpetrator or shoulder part of the compensation.",1,1
"Saying that he didn't intend to spread the word is just saying that his own internet literacy is low.Saying that it was the influencer's fault for spreading the word is also acting in a way that would have been problematic in the first place even if it hadn't been spread.And it is not Sushiro's fault that the influencer spread it, so if you want to sue the influencer and make a claim, but to say that to Sushiro is just shifting the blame.Why do you say you replaced all of them? First of all, you can't specify which ones are the target, and you decided you had to do so because the mere thought of it as a possibility, regardless of the store, would keep customers away.It's true that it's subjective for customers to stop going, but you're the one who made them think that.I don't want to defend any of this.In fact, I'm getting more and more disgusted with Sushiro because of all the false accusations and excuses.",1,1
"Because he is protected by the Juvenile Law, he can get away with it any way he wants, so social sanctions are necessary. Whether the spread of the video was unexpected or not, it is a fact that the video came to light and caused a great deal of loss. It is a matter of course that if you do something wrong, it will come back to you in a roundabout way.This is a good opportunity for companies and society to punish people more severely for their nuisance behavior.",1,1
"The subjective sanction has already been enough, and the reverse question, why did you change all the soy sauce bottles, etc., is not very encouraging, and it could be taken as a lack of remorse, but I think the rights of the victim should be defended rather than the rights of the perpetrator.If it were not for this kind of back-and-forth, I might be able to understand the defense of minors and their age, but in this questioning, it seems as if they are not reflecting on their actions.",1,1
"It should not be that this boy quit high school because Sushiro wanted him to.The claim that he quit on his own accord and is being socially sanctioned is ridiculous.If possible, don't you want Sushiro's side to learn and use social common sense?If he stayed in school, didn't he just run away because he was a needle in a haystack?Unless the school recommended that he be expelled, if so, it is an abandonment of education on the part of the school.The damage caused by the video being broadcast on the Internet is serious, but since it was the act of a minor, it makes sense for the parents to pay for it.The figure of 67 million yen seems to be a very serious figure, and it seems possible to pay it if the debt is spread over two generations.",1,1
"If you are on the defense side, I think it's fair to say that once they are identified, they won't be subject to sanitization except in the relevant stores. I wonder if there needs to be a balance compared to other juvenile cases, such as murder. In Japan, the word ""rehabilitation"" is often used to describe juvenile cases, but in the case of these crimes, why don't they just send the kids to the Self-Defense Forces and have their guts beaten back into them? Parents who are already doing this to their children cannot be rehabilitated. In addition to that, I think it is a crime to violate the right of portrait of people who spread the word, so I would also like to see some legislation.",1,1
"If this is the juvenile's idea instead of the deputy's, his life is over. He has no remorse at all. The replacement of all bottles was to reassure customers. The drastic decrease in the number of customers is due to the influence of the boy. If the crime is forgiven by daily remorse, there is no need for police, courts, prosecutors, or lawyers. Temples and churches are enough. I hope that the amount of compensation will be increased to the order of hundreds of millions.",1,1
"Sometimes someone has to say it out loud.This is a natural act on the part of a restaurant that provides safety and hygiene.If we look back, it is a matter of great inconvenience to the suppliers.If you look only at that part of the problem, it is only that part, but if you look at the scope of our involvement, it is a case that has caused that much damage.",1,1
"It makes me wonder if those who criticize the victim for defending the boy have probably done something similar. Maybe they would go that far? I wonder.On the other hand, the lawyers who are always trying to shift the responsibility to consumers and social networking sites are also unimpressive, although I understand that they can only say such things because of their jobs. I am sure they know that it is a company's way of thinking as to what kind of countermeasures they should take against the risks that have become apparent, and it is their job to give their clients as much advantage as possible, so it can't be helped, but in a so-called ""fuck you"" case like this, all they can do is bow down and ask for leniency. It's not a good idea to do so, because it will only make the victim's nerves flutter. I think Sushiro is probably very motivated to do this.",1,1
"The boy's actions are abnormal even by common sense. If we tolerate it, more and more people will imitate him in today's social networking society.If we allow this to happen, more and more people will imitate them in today's social networking society.This will spread, and the more they spread, the more they will spread.This lawsuit is a good opportunity for children to understand what is good and what is bad.You say you are sorry, but you should be sorry after the outcome of the lawsuit.I think they will realize what a stupid thing they have done.",1,1
"I have been in the backyard of a Sushiro, and I was amazed at how detailed the employees were in washing their hands.I wondered if they went this far and did it over and over again.I guess they have to be that thorough because they are handling such a delicate product.I think Sushiro would not tolerate someone slurping on a teacup or a bottle of soy sauce.",1,1
"The juvenile's argument is so self-serving that it doesn't deserve consideration.On the other hand...The ""spread"" is necessary for the public good.As a restaurant, it would be bad for their image.From the standpoint of the customers who use the restaurant, no matter what the reason may be, it is a matter of life-threatening importance.I don't want the restaurant side to say, ""You can't ""spread"" because it will damage the image.Let's be fair about it.",1,1
"Whether the sanction is sufficient or not at this point is of no concern to me. I would like to see this settled between the affected companies and the juveniles involved.However, I feel that everything about the company's response was necessary.I usually go out to eat, but that video was shocking. It definitely discouraged me from going to the restaurant in any way.",1,1
"I have always had a vague apprehension about things like prepared seasonings, but that video has confirmed my fears. I have become more selective about the clientele at stores that have provided condiments, and I have come to choose stores where the staff will bring them to me as much as possible. I also choose bakeries that display their products on the shelves without covers. I think there are not a few people who are the same way.",1,1
"The act itself is trivial. The damage is due to the spread and spread of the fire. It reminds me of the ""Lost Fire Liability Act,"" and the railroads aren't claiming damages for personal injuries.I think public and nurturing awareness is lacking. If preventive measures were taken, there should be no need for deterrent effect. It should have been taken in the first place. It seems to me that they are taking advantage of the fault and imposing the burden of expense.",1,1
"There are those who say, ""Why such an expensive compensation for ""just this one thing""..."" but that is nothing but a lack of imagination.It is definitely not ""just this one thing.You may want to say, ""I took a little lick,"" but what does it matter because it looks like ""a little""? A ""slight"" deviation from the sidewalk to the roadway can result in a fatal accident.It doesn't matter what the individual's standard for a ""little thing"" is for a nuisance. What is more important is what kind of impact it will have.",1,1
"While it is tempting to hope for a deterrent effect by punishing the perpetrator, the boy's argument is not that wrong, and I think it comes down to a discussion of how to use social networking sites, not food safety, etc.If the theory is that only the boy was at fault and should be held responsible for replacing all bottles, then it would have been better if only the restaurant affected by the incident had replaced the bottles. It is obvious that there is a risk in the system of sharing bottles in the first place, but the logic of not correcting the situation, pouring a lot of money into an inappropriate response, and making the boy pay the full amount is nonsensical. It looks like a performance to punish the boy.While it can be inferred that the social networking site spreading the video was done to attract attention, if we blame the person who posted the video for influencing the number of customers, we can say that the person who spread the influential video also influenced the number of customers (just as a person who retweeted a defamatory statement is considered to have been complicit in the defamation).",1,1
"It would be a company that normally keeps statistics to show that there is no causal relationship between the decrease in sales and the amount of compensation, so they should be calculating the amount of compensation statistically.If the juvenile side says that there is no causal relationship, they should provide the evidence quantitatively, not sensibly.As for the spread of information, the risks of information spreading should have been taught in all classes on information in elementary school, junior high school, high school, and university.Not knowing that it would spread is unfortunate, but it is no excuse.",1,1
"The question is posed to the plaintiff, Sushiro, ""We demand an explanation as to why all soy sauce bottles were disposed of and replaced."" is it not normal to wash them instead of discarding them as it is supposed to be done? The meaning of discarding them is a stunt to make a big show of the damage. There should be no explanation for a reasonable act. It's overkill, crossing the line, and not a calm, mature response. This is digging a grave.",1,1
"When I look at the amount of money, I feel sorry for them.You know, as a company, we're up front about protecting our customers.Taking strict action against a customer who is not a customer is a way of protecting employees.It's fine to put the customer first, but at the same time, you need to put the employees first, too.",1,1
"A price to be paid by himself for quitting school, remorse, and the like, as a matter of course. Compensation to Sushiro is a completely different matter. Sushiro is not a charity. It is a for-profit company, so replacing all the food is a perfectly reasonable decision. It is a decision based on an understanding of customer psychology, and since they were the cause of the situation, they should take responsibility for it.",1,1
"The boy should be charged for the damages he suffered as a result of his actions.However, I think it is also true that Sushiro had factors that contributed to the decline in customer traffic even before this act was committed.This should be clearly separated from the fact that Sushiro had already had a cause for the decline in customer traffic before this action was taken.",1,1
"Because they are using the soy sauce bottle all the time. Or because they think you are using them all the time and are insecure about where they are.By the time it was exposed to the public, the flopped soy sauce bottles may have been offered to others without being cleaned. Or so the public sees it.Because the waiter would not have been aware of the problematic behavior.Because if they had been aware, they would have had detailed information and a situation that would have allowed them to say that it would not have happened otherwise.Since they could not see it, they could only destroy the whole thing.I could see that.Well, what bottles were they using surveillance cameras, etc.? Well, it is possible that they are doing this in parallel with post-processing to verify which bottles are which, using surveillance cameras, etc., in order to resume service as quickly as possible.",1,1
"Why did we replace all the bottles?""Because it was in the national news.Because in a business like that, it is not good to leave sanitation concerns behind,I think it was necessary to say, ""We replaced all bottles"" as an appeal to customers.I think it was necessary to respond by saying, ""All bottles have been replaced.Also, the decline in sales is of course due to competition,I think it is possible to determine if it is due to competition by comparing the sales of a certain period in the past.I think it is possible to judge if it is due to competition or not. The decline in sales has been extreme since the incident.I think they should be able to claim 65 billion yen for the drop in stock price.Personally.",1,1
"There are some things in this world that cannot be undone for what has been doneIn this case, there is no way to take it back.As an ordinary person, I have a hunch that not only Sushiro but also other restaurants might have been licked.Of course, I would like to believe that this is not true, but I am certain that I have some misgivings.I think this issue is no different from terrorism against restaurants in Japan, and not just Sushiro.If you think that if you are sorry, everything will be forgiven, you are mistaken.Make sure you pay the compensation!",1,1
"Think of the damage to the company? It's not just Sushiro, but the entire conveyor-belt sushi industry and restaurants in general, and the damage is immeasurable. Not only this time, but I think the restaurant industry needs to be thoroughly hung out to dry. It has to become the norm in this world. And I think there should be moral lessons at least until high school. I don't know if it's a good idea to have them, but there is a growing momentum to rethink school education, and I don't want people to miss out on this. Because maybe it will get better. If it doesn't, I think it's an achievement to know that it doesn't, so I hope they will pursue it for decades and centuries to come.",1,1
"Since the juvenile's arguments are considered by the lawyers, they are likely to be summarized in terms of what the court would accept based on Japanese law and precedents.We are not defending the juvenile, but if the following logical structure is used, Sushiro's claim will not be accepted by the court.Why did they replace the containers in all stores in Japan?→Æ Because replacing all containers is an appeal to customers for safety and security in response to the possibility that someone may watch the boy's video and commit a similar act, or to the fear that a similar act may have been committed.→The cost for a crime that has not been committed is a preventive cost and is not directly related to the juvenile's act. Moreover, even if the juvenile's actions provoked a third party to commit a crime, the responsibility for the crime should be borne by the person who committed the crime, not by the juvenile.In other words, since what actually occurred was only for the said container in the said store, the cost of replacing the said container would be acceptable, but the preventive and anticipatory costs would not be borne by the juvenile.",1,1
"I don't understand the point of defending the perpetrator. I was surprised that the amount of compensation was so small. I don't understand the point of defending the victim. I'm surprised that the amount of compensation is so small, and I'm worried that it will be reduced to about 1 million yen.",1,1
"If you are going to defend the boy's side, ask yourself this question. ""If a third party vandalized your workplace or home, would you still defend them?"" I would say, ""Yes.If you still intend to defend them, I would positively evaluate you as a person who has a certain will and thought, and who can judge objectively without favoritism.On the other hand, if you cannot bring yourself to defend him, it is a sign that you are aware that you are throwing spears at others that you do not want them to throw at you.",1,1
"I am not inclined to be complicit in either.I don't see the damages as an extension of the safety of Japanese restaurants, workers, or consumers beyond the Sushiro issue, or as a deterrent to behavior that threatens the safety of the consumers....On the other hand, I don't believe that in a civil trial, the amount would be extenuated by social sanctions such as expulsion from high school, let alone in a criminal case.However, it is despicable to use the article's basis for the stock price drop, which is estimated to be more than 16 billion yen at one point in time.For example, when the Great Depression occurs, the stock price will surely fall, and when the world stock market rises, it will surely rise.Stock prices move easily depending on external factors, and stock prices are not determined solely by a company's management efforts. The author of this article knows this, and admits that it is a weak basis, as evidenced by the fact that he added the word ""temporary,"" even though it was a blowout that the stock had fallen 16 billion before.It could be a precedent in the future, I just think it is only a civil case between one company and the perpetrator.",1,1
"Sushiro may still get compensation and there may be some public sympathy. But I might feel more sorry for the other conveyor-belt sushi restaurants. Because for some reason, for no reason at all, we don't go to Kaiten Sushi either, and I think their performance as a whole is declining.I think it was triggered by the sushi pero. There's a regular sushi place nearby that doesn't revolve (and has been for a while), so I just don't care if it doesn't. Plus, it's good. And it's delicious.Surprisingly, the grandmothers seem to have been more shocked.",1,1
"The problem was exposed because the video happened to be spread, but idiots will never go away, and there are people who do it in front of their friends and in places where they can't be seen.I feel that it is time to change the system of using soy sauce, tea powder, etc., which can be used by anyone, and it would be better to put them in a pack like wasabi and hand them out every time.Even if you deter people from taking videos, it won't eliminate the fundamental problem.",1,1
"The action he took was an act of distrust for all restaurants.I wonder if the cost is too great because he made it something that could have happened in any restaurant anywhere?He did something that no normal person would think of doing, so maybe someone else has been doing it longer...Maybe he was valuable enough to tell us that... but it's also true that my family and I ate out a little less after seeing that.",1,1
"Can those who defend it forgive themselves if something like that happened at a store they own and caused damage to the store? I would think so.If it's a privately owned store, they could even be forced to close the store if it's not good enough. The lives of those people are at stake, and Sushiro is a big company and has strength, so it's different to say that we should forgive them.",1,1
"I'm not defending them, but I think replacing the containers and installing acrylic panels is an excessive way to deal with the actions taken. But I also think it is necessary to do so to restore trust. We have to scrutinize the contents of the crime here very closely. There is almost no physical damage. Only the actual cost of cleaning the container and replacing the contents is justified. However, the ""spread of the act"" required not only cleaning and replacing the contents, but also new measures to combat the nuisance, and the stock price has fallen dramatically.This damage was not caused by licking the soy sauce container or spitting on someone else's sushi, but by the ""spread"" of the nuisance. In other words, it is correct to ""claim compensation from the person who uploaded"" the photos that caused the actual damage, not the perpetrator. Or, to take it one step further, we should file a claim for damages against the next person who spread the timed-up or limited-upload video after the person who filmed and uploaded it.",1,1
"In the case of Sushiro, in addition to this Perot incidentlimited products were sold out, or half-price beer was sold out before the campaign.before the campaign and charge the full price.Half-price beers were sold out during the campaign.There have been other incidents, but they have nothing to do with this.In order to prevent this kind of terrorist acts in the future, I would like to see the company not settle out of court for compensation.I hope they win the compensation in court.",1,1
"The boy should also complain about the SNS system because it is the cause of the damage, not just the boy vs. Sushiro.I think it is too convenient for the boy to complain about the negative aspects of SNS, while only taking advantage of the positive benefits of SNS.So I think the validity lies with Sushiro, and the boy should not be upset, and if he wants to complain, he should also complain to Google.",1,1
"Since rehabilitation and reimbursement are two separate events that are compatible, it would not be unreasonable to say that paying tens of millions of dollars would not rehabilitate the victim. The question of whether or not there was malicious intent to spread the information is a question of whether or not there was malicious intent to spread the information itself, but not malicious intent to do so, given the damage suffered by the victim.",1,1
"How much of a causal relationship can be legally proven between Sushiro's declining sales and the Peropero video?The video was filmed, released to the public, and then spread throughout society. Considering the impact on potential customers, the spreading of the video is probably the biggest causal factor.In fact, the diffuser is more likely to be a causal factor than the boy, since no one would have been concerned about the video if they had not known about it.I assume that there are many videos in the world that have been released to the public but luckily escaped diffusion.In other words, there must be cases where sales did not decrease even though the video was filmed and released to the public.If we can carefully prove this, we can conclude that the filming and publication of the video is not the main cause of the decrease in sales, but that the diffusion of the video is the real causal factor.We are looking forward to seeing the defense's skill in this case.",1,1
"I think the person who helped spread the video is responsible. If it had gone through, it would not have spread that far, and it would have been enough to replace the bottles in question. The boy should have apologized to the store in question and deleted the video, which would have been a minimal response.I think the person who spread the story along with the amusing comments is responsible for the fact that the story has become so big.",1,1
"I'm glad I got this amount of money.I thought.Improvement and recovery costs for all Sushiro restaurants.Plus the crash in stock prices due to Sushi-Perokun.Considering that, I think it would be a good thing if they end up paying this amount of money.It's cheap if you think about the possibility that they might get hit again or the price might go up if they bite the hand that feeds them.",1,1
"Regardless of whether this is a factor in defending the perpetrators or not, we must not forget that Sushiro was in a position to be accused of being the perpetrator of a string of scandals until just before this case came to light.It is not surprising that Sushiro would be so bold if it stood on the victim's side after causing so much trouble to its customers through its scandals. It is not surprising that they would be so tough when they are on the victim's side.Of course, this is only a matter of distrust towards Sushiro, and I have no intention of defending the perpetrators, but the decline in customer numbers has certainly given the perpetrators an opening to take advantage of the situation.",1,1
"Anyone who defends the perpetrator is someone who takes misdemeanors lightly. If you cause trouble for others, it doesn't matter as long as you don't cause trouble for yourself. If you are harmed, you are the kind of person who will go all out and sue. I hope Sushiro doesn't settle out of court for a settlement or something.",1,1
"Whether the boy is remorseful or not, whether he has received social sanctions or not enough,Such things have nothing to do with the trial for damages.If the juvenile is remorseful, the damages will be reduced, or if he is not remorseful, the damages will be increased.If you're asking for a sentence or fees in a criminal trial, it can affect the verdict, but it has nothing to do with the amount of damages.",1,1
"〉「All bottles of soy sauce to be replaced　I am not sure about all restaurants, but at the restaurant where I worked, soy sauce and other condiments that customers preferred to use were placed on each table and counter. The next day, before the restaurant opened, we would replenish the seasonings that were low and put them on the tables and counters to welcome customers.So, when we collected all the condiments in one place, we were not in a position to say, ""This is the bottle of soy sauce in question! If the video is circulated, we will eventually have to dispose of or replace all the bottles to be able to serve them to our customers with peace of mind.The decline in sales is also due to competitive factors.　This statement is, in essence, ""The sales decline was due to competition with other restaurants. Sales fell because Sushiro neglected its corporate efforts. It is wrong to put all the responsibility on the boy. I think this is a ridiculous argument with no basis in fact.",1,1
"I can't defend the boy at all, and not only the boy.The photographer and those who provide a place where videos like this can be easily uploaded and published, and where profit can be made from the number of views, are also at fault.From the defense side, I think it is natural to defend them, as the article says.I think it is only natural to defend the boy.If anything, I think that the fact that the food and condiments that everyone can eat are openly available to the public is not a corporate responsibility in the first place. This time it was just a lick, but if it was poisoned and someone died, the company would be held responsible for their safety control...I don't know what will happen in this case.But I am sure that opinions will change depending on who is watching and who is not....However, since I was born in Japan, I would like to be in a country where I can eat rice safely without worrying about it, no matter how much I am called a peaceful country.",1,1
"The boy's side of the story may be the opinion of the lawyer defending the boy, and the lawyer may be just doing his job as a lawyer, but what he is saying is just a bunch of nonsense, or childish, or....Even if he says that he did not intend to spread the video, young people nowadays know what happens if they upload a video, right?It's also laughable that you are playing the victim after being expelled from school.I think you should realize the magnitude of what you have done.",1,1
"I guess I'm in the minority in thinking that I should pay for the bottle of soy sauce I perused, but otherwise I don't think it's necessary.As for the unmanned vending place, I think the psychological hurdle to do something wrong is lowered when there is no human eye on you.I think that if you keep costs down to achieve low prices, there is a certain amount of risk involved.I think it is an illusion that Japanese people have high morals.If they don't do anything, shareholders and others will raise their eyebrows, and I think it's possible to aim for a deterrent effect by claiming a large amount of compensation.",1,1
"The fact that the juvenile was expelled from school has nothing to do with Sushiro.Therefore, Sushiro's claim is reasonable, and since the claim is for compensation from the damage, it does not matter whether the juvenile is socially sanctioned or not.Apart from that, the juvenile has the right to bring a case against the third party on the SNS that drove him to the point of expulsion.",1,1
"The cost of damage and restoration of trust can be charged, but the cost of measures against future similar crimes, such as acrylic panels, would be different.Even the cost of security measures can't be charged to the thief if they get robbed.I know it's 67 million yen, but you can't charge the additional amount, can you?Realistically, I think you can only get 10 million or something like that.",1,1
"It doesn't mean that the perpetrator should not be defended. It is only natural to try to mitigate the crime in some way as a method.Sushiro has already taken this into consideration, and considering the impact on the restaurant industry as a whole, it is not good for them to back down.In any case, the court ruling will not be a case of ""just let the companies cry themselves to sleep. If that were to happen, the companies would have to take countermeasures, and the cost of eating out would jump.",1,1
"If the soy sauce bottle was cleaned up immediately after it was licked, it may still be just that one bottle, but if time or days have passed, it would be impossible to tell which bottle was the licked one, so replacing all bottles would be obvious. If you can clearly see that the decrease in sales is also clearly from the immediate aftermath of the incident, then it doesn't matter what the competitors are doing.",1,1
"Personal Opinion.I hear that this level of compensation is only possible in Japan, but in other countries, especially in the U.S., there are many cases where this kind of compensation is not possible.As for the opinion defending the perpetrators, I personally do not agree with it. As a student, I am not able to judge and recognize what is and is not considered ""bad mishandling"" among my peers, and I think that the media reports and the arguments of those who defend the perpetrators are too poor and self-serving to be considered as such. I think that social sanctions and expulsion from school are nothing more than a self-inflicted punishment for the foolishness of the parties involved.The fact that their relatives are more mentally and physically exhausted than they are is another reason why they are perceived as not truly remorseful. But if they act out, they will be punished more severely than before and the amount of compensation will be increased.",1,1
"The word ""competition"" is thrown around a lot in this case, but what exactly is competition?I looked up the word ""competition"" and found that it refers to ""the overlapping of two or more things on top of the same thing.To be honest, I'm not sure what they are talking about.Perhaps they are trying to say that the sales decline coincided with the issue in question while other professionals in the same field are competing with each other, and that they just feel that way because the sales decline coincided with the issue in question, but that's just a wild guess and there's no way to prove it.Even if that were true, the fact remains that sales actually dropped during that period, so unless you can prove otherwise, there is no way this argument will hold water.What percentage of people would defend the perpetrators?To be honest, it would be better if there were only 10%.I think this issue is an act of contempt for so many people.",1,1
"The juvenile's side is not in a position to argue against it in any way.It is a fact that since that incident, not only Sushiro but also other conveyor-belt sushi chains and restaurants have lost customers and have been forced to take measures against peropero.It is a small price to pay if they can get away with 67 million yen in damages after causing so much trouble to society.I hope they will be able to repay the full amount even if they have to borrow money.",1,1
"I don't think those who are sympathetic to the perpetrators want to defend them, but rather are concerned about public opinion that won't stop bashing them until the perpetrators are dead.The reality is that no matter how much compensation is raised, it is impossible for an individual to suffer the damage of a large corporation.I don't think you can be made an advocate simply by saying you don't want to advocate, but you want to draw the line at voices that insist on sanctioning the perpetrators without knowing the ceiling.",1,1
"As for replacing all the bottles, that may indeed be close to an accusation.I think there are some areas of inadequacy on the part of the store,I think they replaced the bottles because ""other people"" may have done the same thing at other stores and other homes, and I think they are blaming this girl for the sloppy management and hygiene of the store.It would be the same as if they were claiming 10 million yen in damages from a shoplifter because the total amount of shoplifting damage at all of our stores is 10 million yen, right?These incidents are just a case of everyone potentially having suspicions about the hygiene of cheap chain restaurants, and then saying, ""I knew it.To be honest, there are still many old men who don't wash their hands after going to the restroom (you must have seen them if you are a man), but do you think they pick up their chopsticks without touching anything else?But I do think severe punishment is necessary to prevent recurrence.",1,1
"Sushiro's side sought ¥67 million in damages from the boy.As a background, they say that ""the decline in the stock price, which is estimated to be more than 16 billion yen, and the trust issue"" but the stock price was down in the latest incident but has risen considerably since then. If it is relevant, the boy should be compensated for the increase in the stock price.You say it is a ""trust issue,"" but Sushiro itself has probably suffered a decline in credibility due to recent bait advertisements and disguises.I wonder about the attitude of a company that shelves these issues and files a lawsuit for high compensation.",1,1
"In a boy's world, ""it was just a prank.""In the boy's world, ""there was no need to swap bottles.""I can't stop the boy from thinking that and expressing it, but I can't stop him from sayingWhat are the lawyers doing?All they are reported to do is to hit a bad shot to seek extenuating circumstances, but with that kind of work, I wonder if they will be asked to do another one.It might have been one way to ""discreetly point out"" that there might have been something before that as a factor in the decrease in sales, but I have the impression that they are wasting their money by using it as a reason to ask for dismissal of the claim.",1,1
"The perpetrator should not be defended, but the needless slander should be condemned.They are the same but different, and I don't think we should misunderstand that.I think all they could do was to show ""peace of mind"" (even if only for a moment) and ""corporate responsiveness"" by replacing the entire system.As a consumer, I would like to see cameras installed at each table to deter fraud and nuisance behavior, even though it would be out of my budget.To question a company's response after causing a nuisance...it's an ugly foot-dragging and lacks any semblance of sincerity.",1,1
"If I were on the management side, I think Sushiro's opinion is legitimate.On the contrary, I feel that the amount of compensation is conscientious.Sushiro's stock price dropped because of this incident, no doubt.The high school expulsion was no one's fault.The defense will do their job in the best interest of the juvenile as long as they are being asked to do so, but this must be hard.　The lawyer will also lose his reputation.",1,1
"In the general corporate sense, it's in the category of risk management and the amount of damage suffered is really off the charts, but I can't say how this will play out because government judges will only accept the real, true, actual costs.But in reality, Sushiro isn't the only one.After I saw this video on the news, I too have stopped going into restaurants where I can't eat or drink without using something from the table.I don't know if I'm a germaphobe or not, but the thought of someone else doing something naughty makes me sick.I think there are a lot of people like that.If the compensation is too low in this trial, I am afraid that this kind of crime will increase even more.",1,1
"Do you understand that you have reduced the sales of the entire conveyor-belt sushi industry?You should not be in a position to complain even if you are sued by someone other than Sushiro.I think that if Sushiro and other companies don't work together to eliminate this kind of malfeasance, they may end up going down together.Are you afraid that a company suing a boy and claiming huge damages will be seen as evil by the public and damage their image?I don't think there would be as much backlash as in the past in this day and age when everyone can see evil deeds on video.On the other hand, what used to be overlooked as an OK thing to do as long as the same kind of mischief was not exposed can no longer be dismissed as a child's prank.Some people can forgive a single mistake that ruins their entire life ahead of them, while others can't. I guess Kura Sushi is the former, though I would say they cried themselves to sleep.",1,1
"I feel that the more the boy says, the worse he is making his position worse. The reason why they changed all the bottles is that the customers cannot identify the bottles that the boy may have licked, and they can regain some of the customers' trust by saying that they changed all the bottles rather than only the bottles that the boy may have licked.As for sales, even though there have been some mistakes before the boy's case, I think the impact of the boy's case is more significant than the boy's case. I know that the lawyer's job is to reduce or eliminate the compensation as much as possible, but it's too much to argue against.",1,1
"In today's Japan, where the theory of ""goodness"" has collapsed, I think it is important to have a lawsuit to pursue liability for damages. I hope you understand that it is not only the restaurant that has been damaged by this foolish act, but also my family, who used to use Sushiro with my family, can no longer use the restaurant because we feel sick and uneasy, and that this has caused a tremor to many people who use Sushiro. I think the liability for damages is justly deserved.",1,1
"Not Sushiro, but it's been a while since I went to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant and was surprised to find that the sushi was not flowing on the rails.I heard it was due to the nuisance.It may be a good thing from a food loss perspective, but it was a little disappointing because my kids were looking forward to picking up and eating the sushi that was spinning.",1,1
"> Suffering from ""impediments to a peaceful life""The stores are also suffering from ""disruption of peaceful management"".That is slowly being restored by replacing all the bottles, but once the store's credibility is lost, it will not be restored in a few years.Because it is a large chain store, it can sue, but if it is an individual store, it will go out of business and that will be the end of it.Without the ability to sue, they would suddenly find their livelihood cut off and they would be left on the street, and the world would eventually forget about them.The boy should be aware that he did something that could have cost lives, even if it was just a prank.",1,1
"I think I understand this juvenile's side of the argument, but I would like to know who this is in the best interest of, and what the lawyers have decided.No matter how you look at it, the public should be outraged once again, and there is no benefit to them for the rest of their long lives.Since they don't think he's remorseful, he may have even more limited places to work, and I have a feeling that the prospect of repayment is becoming more and more uncertain.Maybe they want to reduce the amount of compensation, but it shouldn't be 100,000 yen or something, and I feel the disadvantages for the boy are too great.",1,1
"Not only in this case, but, it is a bad thing. But what is the current punishment?Originally, only the judiciary could punish, thus maintaining equality in punishment. However, in the information society, punishment by ""exposure"" has exceeded that of the judiciary, and the judiciary has become meaningless.This is ""private punishment,"" in which punishment is carried out by individuals or corporations on their own initiative, and is a setback for the judicial system.If the punishment is too light, the judicial system should be changed, and if ""private punishment"" is used because the punishment is not enough, it means the collapse of the modern judicial system.There is freedom of the press. But is it really freedom to take one person and beat him or her to death?With the media using the ""freedom not to report"" as an umbrella to hide the misdeeds of China, South Korea, and the upper class, isn't it going too far to overreact to the coverage of individuals?This is my opinion.",1,1
"No, I think it is a serious crime to plant the idea that it is possible that the soy sauce bottle provided is a filthy thing that someone has licked. It may not be the first time a boy has licked it. If they think so, replacing all the bottles is the only way to reassure customers.",1,1
"As you say, it's the competitive factors that are causing the decline in sales.That is why, in the midst of fierce competition in the conveyor-belt sushi industry, the suspicion that there may be other bottles licked by others is really a matter of life and death.I suppose there was a necessity to replace all the bottles.",1,1
"There is no way they would accept 60 million yen in damages or any other such damages.They may be trying to make a show of it, but it's a little bit too much.If this is accepted, I think it should be argued that the store is at fault for not foreseeing the appearance of such customers from the beginning.",1,1
"Shocking rebuttal: ""Why did you replace all the bottles?"" and ""The decline in sales is partly due to competitive factors.→I am sure that these are all just hints from lawyers, but clearly, these are answers that can only generate criticism.However, I am very interested to see how the judge will rule on these answers.It will be a touchstone for similar cases in the future.",1,1
"Lawyers structure their logic to give the accused a slight advantage, but do they really mean it?　The juvenile may grow up to be an adult who takes what the lawyer is saying to heart and not reflect on it or interpret it in a way that is convenient. I think the lawyer's responsibility is to defend this juvenile with an eye to his future as well. If the parents are remorseful, too.Why don't you think about the real rehabilitation of this child? Of course, the parents are just as guilty.",1,1
I almost stopped going because of this boy.I was very happy that it was inexpensive.I wondered if such places have a high percentage of people of a certain degree.I made it a point to go to expensive sushi restaurants once instead of several times.The clientele is still different.I am satisfied with both the taste and the restaurant.,1,1
"Well, from our point of view, it is shocking and we think, ""Are you kidding me?"" However, considering the role of lawyers in a trial, this argument and presentation of arguments must have been thought through, including the complication, and we think the lawyers have thought it through.It all depends on how the judge decides whether to accept or reject it, and how he or she will rule on it, so I hope the judge will calmly and appropriately certify the magnitude of the damage.",1,1
"What you did is, of course, a no-no.But when I used to see things like leftover teacups, I wondered if people put used teacups back where they came from. I sometimes wondered.Given that, the potential problem must have surfaced in the worst possible way.I think the conveyor belt sushi restaurant system also had shortcomings in sanitation management, so I thought it might be difficult to place all the responsibility for the cost of countermeasures and lost sales solely on the boy.",1,1
"Even without this incident, there were parents whose children were on the side of the lanes and not paying attention, which I felt was unsavory.But I still thought it was a dirty place, and that is why I watched these videos.I think it's a bit strange in this age of the Internet to admit to being a nuisance, but to say that it wasn't my fault because I didn't intend to spread it around.No matter how much the parents say they are sorry, this means they are not sorry at all.You can't say you didn't think it would spread this far after putting it on the Internet....Your friend who took the picture is just as guilty and should be compensated together.",1,1
"Not only Sushiro, but any place used by an unspecified number of people is expected to get dirty. That is why countermeasures are taken. Not only in restaurants.Without countermeasures, if the place looks unhygienic, the number of customers will decrease.It is expected that there will be people who intentionally or mistakenly make the place dirty.If you find someone who intentionally soiled the food, you can replace only the soiled food.Even if they soiled by mistake, if they report it to the store, only the soiled items can be exchanged.Only the soiled item is compensated for the damage.The store needs to find it, and the customer needs to report the stain.However, since there is leakage, if they find dirt, they should clean and replace it as soon as they find it, and furthermore, they should clean and replace it regularly.Customers are also required to check for dirt when they use the room. If they see someone soiling the sink, they should report it to the store.The problem in this case was that the store did not find the stain. The customer did not report the stain. That the customer uploaded the soiling act on social media. Spreading the word.The biggest problem is that it spread. The spreading cannot be prevented.",1,1
"It is a matter of lawyers. Lawyers are in the business of turning black into white, and it would be a good opportunity to let the boy know that he is not alone in what he did just for the fun of it.",1,1
"The media basically takes the side of the few. They provide material for the public to think about, and are not in a position to judge right from wrong.If public opinion is burning up in support of the company and the boy, as it was in this case, they will tell the boy's side of the story.The company seems to want to blame the juvenile for all the losses after the incident, but I don't think that's true.Even before the incident, the company had failed to adequately prepare items for sale and had been criticized multiple times as a bait advertisement.The boy's incident on top of that would indicate that the company was disgusted with the store management system that allowed such inappropriate incidents to occur.",1,1
"It is written as if only the boy in the video is being charged, but I believe the contributors are probably being sued together. (67 million combined for two or more people)Some say the influencers should be compensated as well, but the influencers are not involved in this case.We need to let people know that putting a video on the Internet is an act of dissemination.",1,1
"When asked if there was a need to change all the bottles, at least I can't trust anyone to do that because other restaurants just don't have the video up. I mean, I used to go there every month since then, but I don't go there anymore. I can't even count the number of people who do that, but I think it has at least had a big impact on sales.",1,1
"An insurance company friend once told me about a case in which a pedestrian (bicyclist) acted carelessly and drove a car into a convenience store, resulting in a bill of several hundred million yen to the pedestrian for store repairs, business compensation, personal injury compensation, and other expenses.Considering such a case, I thought that the store, which was damaged by the boy's action, would be charged a much lower amount.I am interested to see how much the court will accept the store's claim for secondary damage, but I think that the secondary damage to the boy (expulsion from school, inability to live a peaceful life, etc.-which might be taken into account if it were a criminal penalty) is irrelevant to the damages.",1,1

"＞ The trial was completely unpredictable. It is only natural for both sides to argue their respective positions, but with the way things are going, we can expect a protracted trial.In the normal course of events, the circumstances of the perpetrator, such as expulsion from high school or social sanctions, have nothing to do with the victim. It is the victim's natural right to demand an amount of money equivalent to the damage he or she has suffered. Even this amount is rather low. If the court were to make a decision in accordance with social common sense, it would be in the best interest of the victim.The problem, however, is that the courts sometimes lack social common sense beyond belief. The victim's lawyer's argument that the rumors and damage control measures were unnecessary is completely insane from a social perspective, but the fact that the court is one of the most old-fashioned and hard-headed organizations in Japan does not negate the possibility that it will be accepted. Depending on the judge, there is a good chance that the compensation could be an incredibly small amount. That is what concerns me the most.",1,1
"There is a saying, ""One punishment, one hundred commandments.My cousin, who was 20 years old at the time, was the kind of guy who mixed coffee milk with a glass of water in a restaurant.Although it was not an action that had a serious impact on hygiene, there are a certain number of people in society who have no psychological resistance to playing tricks in food-related settings, so it is significant to spread the awareness that ""a penalty awaits you if you do it.",1,1
"I think the boy's argument would stand if he had not filmed and uploaded the video, but regardless of the circumstances, once a video like that spreads throughout Japan and around the world, it is no longer a matter of ""just replace the soy sauce at this table in this restaurant"" anymore.Sushiro will gain nothing from the boy's social sanction. It will not reduce the damage. And yet, it seems unreasonable to ask for a reduction in compensation.I don't think we need to push the boy any harder than necessary, but if we don't make him take at least some responsibility, Sushiro's side will end up crying itself to sleep, and that's not justice.",1,1
"This incident may have been lucky for Sushiro in terms of timing. This is because just prior to the incident, Sushiro was under fire for its half-fraudulent beer and storytelling advertisements. It is an indisputable fact that after the incident, the number of customers was sluggish and a certain number of customers were flowing to competitors. The media, which loves flames, was able to change their target from Sushiro itself to the boy who caused the damage to Sushiro, and the company found itself successfully transformed from a perpetrator to a victim. If Sushiro was the target of the flames, then they have a very good planner on their hands.",1,1
"They may have received social sanctions as a criminal case like obstruction of business.However, Sushiro, the victim, does not feel happy because he has been punished. The compensation to Sushiro for the damage is yet to come.I don't think we should consider criminal and civil cases at the same time.",1,1
"I wonder if this is something a lawyer would say. It is a poor idea.Even though this is not just a problem for the perpetrator and Sushiro. It is the worst problem for the restaurant, because it has made people who know about the incident distrustful and suspicious of others.I can eat the food because there is no hard evidence that someone is doing it, even if I am concerned about the prohibition of twice-dipping the shish-kebabs in sauce, but when I am presented with the video evidence that this is happening, I think the only way to dispel this suspicion is to replace all the bottles.It is also a problem between the perpetrator and Sushiro customers.After this incident, I don't go to Sushiro anymore.Or rather, I don't go to such an unattentive restaurant anymore. I go to small stores where I can't do anything malicious.",1,1
"It's not as if they would replace all the plates and chopsticks if a video of them licking the plates and chopsticks came out.I understand the mood, but it is unlikely that the principle of actual damages would allow one person to bear the entire cost of the mood. The bottle replacement, the lawsuit, should all be seen as part of the marketing.The amount of the lawsuit seems to be a deterrent, and the lawsuit would be unreasonable, knowing that such an amount of compensation would not be granted. It is very likely that when things settle down, the amount will be undisclosed and a settlement will be reached.",1,1
"Once the customer was made to suspect that he or she may have been perused at his or her seat, Sushiro decided that it could not dispel his or her suspicions unless all the soy sauce jugs were replaced.What other reason could there be? At the very least, the incident caused a loss of customers, forced them to change the system, and forced them to make unnecessary investments in facilities, such as installing acrylic panels.It doesn't matter to Sushiro if the boy dropped out of high school voluntarily or not. It may depend on the decision to send him to a juvenile detention center or something, but I don't agree with any of the juvenile's arguments that he is being lenient with civil lawsuits.",1,1
"You've given us another reason to flame you.In fact, it is probably the only reason that can be offered as a counterargument, but isn't this a bad argument for a case that has become a social issue, even if it is a case that is quietly handled among interested parties?Or is it a good defense for an individual who wants to reduce his debts regardless of his own actions, unlike a company that is concerned about image damage?Well, it is certainly not socially acceptable.",1,1
I believe this problem can be anticipated in advance.I believe that a young child would hold the exit of the soy sauce container with his/her hand or grab the teacup with an unwashed hand and put it back. So I think a system was needed to prevent this in advance!,1,1
"I understand Sushiro's position tremendously, but the boy does not have the ability to pay the bill in the first place. The boy is a minor rather than an adult, even though he is a parent. I don't even know if the parents can pay the full amount. The person who spread the news, the person who uploaded the video, and the person who took the video should each be billed as well. It may be troublesome, but it is too unrealistic to pursue the amount of money and responsibility that cannot be paid to one person. It may feel like an example, but that would only be a loss for Sushiro.",1,1
">The boy also states that he had no ""intention"" to share this ""nuisance"" with many people through the Internet, and that he did not anticipate its spread. Its spread was by a well-known influencer, and the spread was not the boy's intention.>The court also rejected Sushiro's claim for damages, saying that some of the decline in sales was due to ""competition,"" and that the hygiene rumor issue was ""extremely subjective to consumers,"" denying any relationship to the juvenile's conduct and asking that the claim be dismissed. The juvenile's side also requests ""an explanation as to why all soy sauce bottles were disposed of and replaced.""＞The juvenile's conduct is not directly related to the impact on Sushiro's management or customers, not to mention the emotional consequences of his actions at the expense of his friends, which he did not intend to spread, and which have prevented him from dropping out of high school and leading a peaceful life.What are the lawyers thinking...isn't this just fuel for the fire? All of these claims.",1,1
"The Sushiro side has been forced to deal with a variety of issues, and a considerable number of executives and staff have probably had to increase their workload.If you consider the scale of all the stores, I don't think the personnel cost alone would be less than 60 million.If sales are lower than planned, the loss of foodstuffs and excess personnel will also be a huge amount of money for the entire store scale.",1,1
"Sadly, I think it is very unlikely that this boy will be rehabilitated. I believe that the challenge now confronting adults is to begin discussions on fundamentally reforming the social system, the educational system, and the family that produced such a juvenile the way it should be.",1,1
"In the past, perhaps both parties could have resolved the issue with a more pliable response. But even if it is a litigation strategy, I feel that the victim's lawyer's comments are not sympathetic. Also, for Sushiro, if they did nothing or showed appeasement, they might get a shareholder lawsuit. If they can be forgiven for causing damage and then being remorseful, then that would be ""no need for the police"".",1,1
"I don't think I can defend it. However, a trial and ethics are two different things, and it is impossible to say whether they can get 67 million. As for social sanctions, the fact that there was a string of slander after the incident may be taken into account at the trial. If compensation is to be paid, I think it would be better to make the perpetrator, the photographer, the person who spread the information, and the people who slandered him pay.",1,1
"There are a certain number of children who get carried away and don't listen to their parents because of their personalities, which may have a slight influence on those parents not wanting to eat at risky restaurants with their children.Prices are going up, and I think there is a trend to eat out less, even when considering the family budget.",1,1
"How does this compare to past precedents?If the food or drink was poisoned, it would be the Glico-Morinaga case, but if it was just a little licked saliva, at most it could be a stomach ache or food poisoning, although it could have been corona since it was the corona season.How about comparing it to other punishments as well? For example, is 70 million yen cheaper or more expensive than a hit-and-run drunk driving case? Is it high or low compared to murder? If you are happy to pay a large amount of money for someone else's mischief, you will be strangling yourself sooner or later.For example, if you throw up on the street on your way home after getting drunk and leave the vomit on the street, you may be identified by a camera and charged 70 million yen, or you may be charged 100 million yen for breaking your shoulder just by bumping into a passerby.I'm afraid we're going to end up in that kind of era.",1,1
"Don't they also need to apologize to the shareholders who suffered losses from the decline in stock prices?Lawyers are the kind of people who will do anything for the benefit of those they defend, so they are not afraid to say things that offend the feelings of the victims.Well, it can't be helped because that's the kind of work they do, but what about them as human beings? I feel like, ""I don't know, I just don't know.I'm sure the reason for ""demanding an explanation as to why all soy sauce bottles were disposed of and replaced"" is to minimize the damage caused by the assailant boy and to get rid of any damage to the image of the company.",1,1
"Once you've confirmed the occurrence of the tampering, you'd have to eliminate everything that has even the slightest chance of being tampered with, rather than trying to determine when and where in the restaurant the tampering took place and where in the restaurant it took place, and then eliminating that bottle.If there's even the slightest chance of having such an unsanitary bottle, you can't be open for business.If you have to shut down all the restaurants until you identify the bottles, and compensate for the wasted food, the employees who have to be absent on short notice, the sales that would have been generated, and other damages, you can't just replace all the bottles, can you?On the contrary, I think they were lucky to have replaced all the bottles without shutting down operations.",1,1
"Let's put the emotionalism to the side at this point.Sushiro is a publicly traded company, and it was necessary to take certain considerations into social consideration.It is clear from the fact that Sushiro is a company with high annual sales, and yet it is suing for an amount of money that it deems appropriate for the damage caused by the size of its business.Also, the stock price temporarily fell by a total of 16 billion yen, but it returned to normal two days later. The company's business flow and costs need to be improved as a result of the nuisance behavior that has been observed in many places, and Sushiro has become a party to it.The lawyer for the juvenile side is in the most important position in the defense to seek the maximum benefit for the juvenile side, and it is a legitimate act to ask Sushiro's side to logically respond with objective facts.Based on these considerations, the court concluded the case by considering the following: how much disadvantage Sushiro would suffer, and whether the juvenile side would receive appropriate social sanctions.",1,1
"It's a civil suit.It's a case for damages.It's a civil case to recover damages the juvenile caused Sushiro.It's a civil case.It doesn't matter if the juvenile's lawyer says that he dropped out of high school or that his peaceful life isalienated, or whatever.For the Sushiro side.In a civil suit, against the plaintiff (Sushiro).Rather than the defendant (juvenile side) litigating the case,Defendant (juvenile side) needs to be willing to admit or settleThe defendant (juvenile side) needs to be willing to admit what needs to be admitted.The attorney for the juvenile side has completely misjudged the litigation policy.The juvenile's lawyer is completely misjudging the policy of the lawsuit.",1,1
"Certainly the juvenile's conduct is not an acceptable act in terms of social ethics. It is understandable that he should seek compensation within the bounds of common sense. However, although this may not be the case, Sushiro has caused annoyance and discomfort to many consumers in the past with their fraudulent campaigns, but they have quietly and only tokenistically apologized, haven't they? I think that was the bigger problem.What is Sushiro's position on this?",1,1
"All bottle replacements are minimally necessary to eliminate the cause for concern.Normally, in the event of foreign material contamination, a company will always recall all of its production.The boy's side does not understand the seriousness of the situation and does not feel any remorse when he is refuting this.They also do not understand that there are many customers who saw the video and were offended by it. Naturally, not only Sushiro, but the entire restaurant industry was affected.From the company's point of view, the amount charged is too low.",1,1
"A crime is a crime, and I don't think excuses are allowed.I think it would be better to make a statement of remorse and request a certain amount of reduction.I think it would be better to settle the case by expressing your remorse and demanding a certain amount of reduction.The company is not an ogre and will take the situation into consideration.I think they will take the situation into consideration.I think you have to make a certain amount of payment every month.I think it would be a good idea to raise funds through YouTube or some other means, and to promote Sushiro by posting videos of the good things about Sushiro.Can't they think that far ahead?",1,1
"In Japan, unlike in the U.S.punitive damages are not allowed in Japan.Punitive damages are not allowed in Japan, unlike in the U.S.causal relationship cannot be established.A drop in the stock price is only temporary.If there is no actual damage to the company's finances, it is not allowed.The necessity of an acrylic board is also unclear.As anyone who is not familiar with the law can understand.Even if you claim 90 million yen, it will be a waste of time and money.",1,1
"She was unlucky too, wasn't she? Didn't she get hit with a problem that she didn't do when she went to the store for something called a fair? Isn't that why she's shifting the blame for the drop in customer traffic? But that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it...social networking sites are just the tip of the iceberg, and there are probably a lot of people doing it who aren't mentioned. The staff should patrol the store more often. It's true that touch screens are convenient, but I wonder if there aren't actually many people doing the same thing just because no one is looking. I think that's why I go to sushi restaurants that don't rotate.",1,1
"This small amount of compensation is not enough to rehabilitate them, so I would like you to fix a compensation of about 100 times this amount. Also, since rehabilitation cannot be achieved only through civil cases, I would like you to send the case to the criminal court for obstruction of business. This may be a family court case, but even under the current law, it is necessary to give criminal penalties.",1,1
">This issue, which was triggered by the boy's ""nuisance videoAlthough it is a ""crime"" video, not a ""nuisance"" video, and the remorse of the perpetrator and social sanctions are irrelevant in a civil suit for damages, if the main purpose of the Sushiro management company in filing the lawsuit is to make an example to society to warn people that even a minor prank by a person can have serious consequences, then the court will ultimately recommend a settlement, and the defendant boy and his parents and the boy's parents will be able to get their lives in trouble in the future. If the main purpose of the lawsuit by the Sushiro management company is to make an example to warn society that even minor pranks can have serious consequences, then I am sure that the court will eventually recommend a settlement in which the defendant juveniles and their parents will pay the plaintiff Sushiro management company a settlement amount that will cover the cost of the lawsuit and a settlement that they will not have to live with in the future.",1,1
"The boy's side said, ""I didn't anticipate the spread.""It is not acceptable to say that the boy did not anticipate the spread of the message when he posted it in a place where many people could see it, regardless of whether it was posted under lock and key. In fact, did he not post it for the purpose of spreading the message?Decrease in customer traffic is ""extremely subjective psychology of consumersThe ""extremely subjective psychology of consumers"" was triggered by the boy's posting of the video.""Is it necessary to destroy all bottles?""It is up to the store to decide whether or not it is necessary to destroy all bottles or equipment, depending on the situation. It is not right for the perpetrator to ask if it is necessary. The store has decided that it is necessary in order to promote safety and security to consumers. I do not think it is excessive.The expulsion from the high school was not because of the lawsuit, but because the juvenile deserved it for his shallow behavior that led to the lawsuit, and it would not have happened if the juvenile had not posted the unsolicited video.I hope the boy's lawyer admonishes the boy more and encourages him to be more remorseful rather than reducing his compensation.It doesn't sound like he is very remorseful.",1,1
"A half-hearted response is bound to cause similar problems. I believe that the greatest defense is to show that you will not tolerate even minors, and this in turn will protect the safety of the users.",1,1
"It is certain that the effects of his actions have reduced sales on a non-negligible scale (regardless of how accurately that amount can be estimated). Whether he drops out of high school or his peaceful life is threatened, the affected Sushiro will not receive a single yen. As long as he lost money that he could have had, it is only natural that he should make up for it with money.",1,1
"He says he did not spread the video, but if he had not done so in the first place, the video itself would not have existed, and he is responsible for the video being leaked. The boy can claim compensation from his friend who took the video and the person who spread it, but he should compensate Sushiro himself.",1,1
"Sushiro is suing the boy but not his parents, who are responsible for his supervision, and it would be tough for an 18 year old or so to pay this amount. But they have no intention of collecting from the parents. In other words, Sushiro's goal from the beginning was not to collect compensation, but rather to include a warning against the increasing number of nuisances.",1,1
"It could be argued that most of the high damages are due to the sharp decline in stock prices, but since this is a nationwide chain, if the same measures are taken at all the stores, the amount would be quite high.In Japan, unlike in the U.S., it is impossible to prove a causal relationship between a sharp decline in stock prices and the company, so it is not allowed to do so. In the U.S., such cases are allowed for the purpose of deterring such incidents, and they are even taught in school education from childhood, so no one would do such a thing.What kind of nerve do people have to criticize Sushiro? One thing I can say is that a company that has caused scandals before the annoying videos should not charge so high and mighty.",1,1
It's normal to replace all bottles.I don't care if it's fixed to the table and doesn't move.But if it's fixed to the table and you can move it freelyOther customers can't tell which bottles have been sloshed on.I can't rest assured unless you tell me that all the bottles have been replaced.,1,1
"I wonder if there is an opinion that the author feels is not defending the perpetrator, but defending the perpetrator because of the unreasonableness of Sushiro's side of the argument.Even if there was a decrease in sales due to the boy's video, how could a video of a boy in Gifu Prefecture have affected Sushiro stores from Hokkaido to Okinawa? It is reasonable to assume that it is because Sushiro operates its stores under a sanitary management system that allows such pranks to occur. In fact, there were many similar unsolicited videos posted that appeared to have been made by other people. Few customers would have refrained from coming to the store thinking that the boy might travel freely from Hokkaido to Okinawa and play pranks all over the place. Therefore, I personally believe that the boy's video only served as an opportunity to make the world aware of Sushiro's sloppy hygiene management system, which allows such pranks to take place, and that the root cause of the decline in sales was the Sushiro side.",1,1
"Many in the media think that defending them is a sense of justice, but the people who write the articles andThe people who are broadcasting the story are just playing nice because they are worried that if they say the opposite, they will be thought of as bad guys.In Japan, the perpetrators are not so easy to deal with, and foreigners are sometimes heard to say that in Japan, even if you do something bad, the crime is light and you can get out of jail quickly, and if it is a minor crime, you will be released immediately. So I repeat it.I demand that we be more sympathetic to the feelings of the victims, and that the perpetrators be punished severely with no remorse.There are many people who break someone's store or property and are not even sent to jail for a few years or on probation and live a normal life. Of course, they don't have to pay for the damage, they just lose the money.I hope that this joke of a law will be revised soon so that those who cause damage to others will have to pay for the rest of their lives.",1,1
"I'm sure the impact of the similar cases before that, and Sushiro, I think it was, are also contributing to the decline in sales. I think that the impact of the previous similar case, and the decoy advertisement, etc., also contributed to the decline in sales, but it's hard to blame it all on this person... It would be quicker to put all the blame on the culprit we can see now, but....I think that if they are charging a huge amount of money as a performance to deter similar cases from occurring, I think that by the time the case is settled, the amount charged will be significantly reduced to less than 10 million yen.The previous statement, ""Punish those who spread the video!"" I wonder if that is not the case in this case? I thought that in the past, the video diffusers were punished as well...",1,1
"If you had not done such a silly thing in the first place, you would not have been put on that scale.If you will allow me to express my personal opinion""The prank of bizarre behavior has gone too far,"" that's all I have to say.I don't think anyone who has received proper instruction from his or her parents would have done such a thing.I don't think it is for people to say that the punishment for this boy's crime is ""too heavy"" or ""too light"" or that he has already been socially sanctioned. The person who defended him can't be held accountable when he re-offends (well, the person who defended him doesn't have to take it).I think it is up to each person to weigh the severity of the crime and the punishment. I think all we need is a sentence between the victim, the offender, and the court.",1,1
"It's going to be hard to charge for all the bottles.It's not like the boy's scope of activity was nationwide.Sure, it affected the whole country, but indirectly and not directly, so it's impossible to claim it as a bottle bill.It's only natural that the waiter should bring the bottle to each customer.But they cut corners and left the bottles there for a long time, and that's why the price is so low.That's why the price is lower.This is a problem that usually does not occur in a face-to-face store.",1,1
"You are just trying to mix up a criminal trial and a civil trial to attract public sympathy.In a criminal trial, ""socially sanctioned"" is an extenuating circumstance that may affect the sentence. However, in the case of civil damages, no matter how much social sanction the perpetrator receives, nothing will compensate for the loss of the affected company. That's all there is to it.",1,1
"All bottles were replaced → Since it was not known which bottles were the target bottles, all bottles had to be processed.Decrease in sales→Until the store in question is identified, it is unclear which store this incident occurred at, so the number of customers dropped. If the number of customers at competing stores is rising, the perpetrator's argument may be accepted.The reason for the extremely subjective mindset is the Sushi-Perot video.The reason for the extremely subjective mindset was the Sushi-Perot video. It is more naive to think that it will not be diffused by uploading it to the Internet. If that is the case, the influencer who spread the video should be sued for compensation.If it was a third party who uploaded the video, it would be understandable. However, the video was uploaded by the person himself. It would have been better if he had not uploaded it.I think this is about it.",1,1
I think it was an extremely offensive offense. I cannot tolerate such shenanigans that trample on a restaurant's efforts to make people feel safe and have a good time. It is shortsighted and extremely violent. It disrespects public order and morals. I also think this kind of behavior comes from the premise that there are people who find such people amusing in part. I don't think this is a problem that can be solved with an apology.,1,1
"Not only this case, but after a series of disturbing disturbances, our family has definitely reduced the number of eating out itself.Even at the occasional meal out, we have reached the point where we don't touch or use anything that is left on the table.Even if our family's pattern is extreme, the fact remains that the number of customers has decreased,I think the loss incurred by each company is not small.I wonder if the people who are defending them are doing so because of the amount of compensation?I also see people saying, ""You don't have to go that far..."",Personally, I don't blame them if they go that far.I think there is a difference between human rights and overprotection for the perpetrators.I am disappointed that there are people who really mean what they say in the sentence ""I am disappointed in Sushiro.",1,1
"Companies must express losses quantitatively in monetary terms toshareholders will not be convinced.Considering the damage to the company's image and the cost of countermeasuresthe amount of the loss is still low, and it is not just a matter of one Sushiro company.It is not just a matter of one Sushiro company.It is not just a problem for Sushiro, but also for other companies.This is the best example of the bad habit of SNS, which allows unrelated onlookers to say whatever they want.",1,1
"What about from a legal standpoint? Disposal damage from a licked bottle is recognized as direct harm. What about the disposal of other bottles? There is no evidence that the boy licked the bottles. Therefore, the disposal of the other bottles would be at the discretion of the company and would not be recognized as damage. Can the company prove the amount of damage caused by the loss of image and stock price? Even in ordinary civil trials for damages, there is a large difference between the amount claimed and the amount awarded. In this case, the company is claiming tens of millions of yen, but I think it will end up with a small amount in the end.",1,1
"The argument is that it is the spreader's fault.But the fact that they spread the word means that the people who thought that there might be such a thing, but never thought that it existed, now know that there really is a fool who does such things.According to what I have heard, you don't see such a thing in other countries, even the tastings of small pieces of food at supermarkets and the like. The reason for this is that there is no guarantee that anyone will misbehave.The proliferation of the video has taught us that such an era of ""easygoing and without need for caution"" has come to an end. I believe that the video should have been spread, even though it would have cost the company a lot of money. It taught us that times have changed and that there are a lot of fools out there.",1,1
"The claim on the impact on Sushiro, who is normally not a child and is remorseful and socially sanctioned, would not have happened if you had not done it yourself in the first place. I'm not entirely sure what would happen if you did this, but the impact would be minimal and even an idiot would think twice before doing it. The fault lies with himself, no matter how you look at it. I don't know if I can say that I am not the one at fault because I am sorry for it. I understand that this is a lawyer's idea, but I guess this is the part where you are told 100 and you try to take less than 50 from 0.",1,1
"If something like that happened, I would be deterred from visiting other companies' stores in the same form.I don't understand the idea of bringing up a competitor's story when I think the entire industry is being damaged.Instead, I personally think it's a case where the entire industry, including competitors, could have been sued and the order of magnitude would have gone up by about two orders of magnitude.",1,1
"I think they should be punished severely, even if they are juveniles.Those who put up such videos and play with them (even if that was not their intention, their conduct is not good in the first place) are a bunch of bastards.They say they are sorry, but are they really?Even if it is just for fun,It is only natural for them to make amends for what they have done.If we ask for forgiveness because there is no malicious intent, we will end up with a bunch of inconsiderate people.In addition, the fact that Sushiro only licked the container in this case would not even be funny if the container had been poisoned.Sushiro's action should be justified, and they have no right to be blamed for it.",1,1
I'm sure that I no longer feel like eating the leftover gari or whatever they do to me anymore. I think the reimbursement of 67 million yen is too cheap.,1,1
"I have nothing at all to defend against the perpetrators.They should be brought to justice, and any act that ""intentionally"" destroys the business and, if anything, the culture of kaiten-zushi is unforgivable.I feel that the amount of damages should be several times or even a hundred times higher than the amount claimed.However, the ""total replacement of soy sauce containers"" is a little questionable in terms of Sushiro's daily hygiene management.The reason is that items such as these, which are freely touched by customers, should be thoroughly disinfected every day and replaced with new ones on a regular basis, as they can be left in unsanitary conditions ""even if unintentionally"".Even if Sushipero happened, it would be understandable if, for example, the company presented its existing hygiene management standards, saying that it disinfects the food every day and replaces it with new food about once a month, and that it also replaced it with new food on an occasional basis.Again, I am not defending the perpetrator. The bill should be higher.But I don't think the cost of replacing the soy sauce jug has anything to do with the case.",1,1
"I don't know about others, but the Sushiro in my town has no covers, and the ones that have been exposed to the air of people coughing here and there come around, even if they are ordered. If it were fully ordered like Kappa with a cover like Kura, it would still be acceptable, but in these days of the Corona craze, I don't think Sushiro has this, and they seem to be doing cheating advertisements, and even without this incident, it would have been a step in the decline. I asked my co-workers about it, and all they said is that they don't go there anymore. There are many countermeasures that can be taken, such as using soy sauce packets and only using spoons for the number of people, and there are some places that are doing so. It is obvious that the boy is at fault, as he is the one who is responsible for the lack of action on his part and is demanding a large sum of money for it. If you put a surveillance camera in the kitchen, it is likely to pick up the stuff that falls on the ground with a 5-second rule or something.",1,1
"It is because it gives the impression that the video is not exclusive to that store.The chain stores may have slightly different layouts, but they all operate the same way, so this was done to prevent that video from being made in other stores.It also hurt the store's desire to trust its customers.",1,1
"Certainly a certain number of advocacy arguments are noticeable. I think that the claims of experts that high compensation cannot be obtained before the results of the trial are even known are a variant of the same type of advocacy. Recently, I feel that not only on the Internet but also in the real world, public sentiment tends to be extremely impersonal and uniformly too much. People tend to be critical and righteous when it comes to other people's gaffes or slight missteps. What is the reason for such a relatively tolerant attitude toward incidents such as this one? What is the reason why people seem to be relatively tolerant of incidents such as this one? Is it because more and more people are thinking, ""I want to make easy money on youtube.",1,1
"It's like, ""This wouldn't have happened if it hadn't been spread,"" as if the influencer who spread the word was at fault.I think that's true if you talk about ""codswallop"", but it doesn't matter whether you expected it to be spread or not, the issue is that you did something that is ""a very important hygiene issue"".And the time when this video was spreading was when the disease was not yet class 5.In addition, if ""if social sanctions have already been imposed, the damages will be paid off,"" people may take advantage of the situation and abuse the situation.In the old days, there may have been some leniency for helping out in the dishwashing store, but we should not forget that this was a private store and that being beaten up by the owner was often a prerequisite for such a thing.",1,1
"There is something wrong with the Japanese climate.The perpetrator, the boy, is 100% at fault and must be held accountable.He must then compensate the company for the damages.The amount of compensation is calculated by the company since this is a court case.It is not right to complain about this.Since it is a trial, the amount of compensation is ultimately determined by the judge's decision.Too many people do not understand that this is only the plaintiff's claim made in the trial.The amount may be reduced or even approved as a result of the trial.Or conversely, it might be made higher.Understand the trial.",1,1
"How will the courts decide?For example, if the manager found me and took me to his office on the spot, I heard there are a few precedents that only allow for the replacement cost of that seat only.I heard that there is no precedent for all the chains in a wide area due to the spread of the video, so this could be an indicator for the future.",1,1
"The basic premise is that what the boy did is unforgivable and that this lawsuit is justified, but unfortunately similar acts will not disappear no matter how high the damages won.This is because a certain number of people do not watch the news and do not know about it.The only way to realistically eliminate it is to also incriminate the influencers and the media who spread the nuisance.",1,1
"Has the lawyer in charge only dealt with criminal cases?If it's a criminal case, there would be no repercussions if the prosecution and the lawyer went at it.However, in a civil case, the victim and the offender face each other directly.How do you think the victim would feel if he/she was told that your claim is bullshit?I think it's safe to say that the road to reconciliation is now closed.If you settle the case after being told this, it would be an admission of the boy's side of the story.Then there is the question of the amount of damages in the judgment.If the judge's verdict is 1 million yen for a claim of 67 million yen, it will give the impression that Sushiro's claim has been rejected.A second lawsuit would have to be considered.",1,1
"Let this boy and his family be the cornerstone of precedent setting. ......I'm curious to see where the main culprit for ""spreading the video"" is considered to be.1. the perpetrator of the nuisance and the person who filmed it. Video sharers.2. The person who saved the annoying video to a place where anyone can view it, thinking that he/she is circulating it only among his/her friends.3. The person who found it by accident and posted it on a certain bulletin board as a nuisance.4. People who were outraged by the video and solicited information in various places to identify it.5. Youtubers who found out that it was a hot topic and took it up in their own distribution.At what point do they qualify as ""spreading the rumor"" and become the main culprits in spreading the rumor?If all of them claim that they did not intend to harm the reputation of the restaurant, where and to what extent will they be awarded damages?At the time of the incident, the police were immediately consulted, and a TV station heard about it and submitted a video to the police, which made the news. If the store's sales are affected as a result, will the person in 3 and the TV station be awarded damages?",1,1
"Those who defend the boy probably have never worked in the private sector.They are too narrow-minded and too unimaginative.You say you did not intend for the video to spread, but did you upload it with a setting so that only you yourself could view it?If it is set so that multiple people can view it, then it is ""intended to spread"".And some social networking sites have a retweet function, such as Twitter, so creating a situation where you can do that = it's OK to spread the message.The lawyers on the boy's side are probably just saying that because it's their job,Why don't they prepare a more solid rebuttal?It's like a ""child's excuse.",1,1
"For example, if someone shoplifts from a convenience store, and the cost of installing security cameras and hiring security guards nationwide for that purpose, can we charge the shoplifter 100 million yen? That would be the story.If such a thing were allowed to go unchallenged, everyone would have to be frightened of receiving extremely high bills from all sources.A 67 million yen bill is too much.",1,1
"If he apologizes for the wrong he did and begs for a reduction because he can't afford to pay so much, I can still understand, but I am outraged at the perpetrators playing the victim or asking for an explanation why they changed all the bottles, which is an argument I can't even begin to understand.In order to reduce the number of people like this, this time the punishment needs to be severe. I think it is a good idea.",1,1
"I wonder if any of the guests arrived at this table after these boys took the video?If I were, I would be beyond sickened!I wonder if this is a statement from a lawyer who has thought that far ahead.I wonder if the people who went to this store on the date and time this video was taken could also take some action against these boys!",1,1
"&gt; The trial has been completely unpredictable. It is only natural that both sides will argue their side of the story, but with the way things are going, we can expect a protracted trial.Isn't it expected that the opposing side's lawyers will come up with these quibbles since they have filed the lawsuit ?Or did you think they would raise the white flag from the beginning?You should just proceed with your work in a dignified manner.",1,1
"After that incident, I simply got sick of the first half of the conveyor belt sushi, from the plates to the teacups to the soy sauce and so on.Even though I know in my head that such an incident is unlikely to happen, I can't help but think, ""What if...?I don't think it's possible that most people are defending the boy.In fact, I think the entire conveyor-belt sushi industry has suffered because of this annoying boy.He says he had no intention of spreading the news,Even elementary school students are taught that if you put something on the Internet, it can spread, so even if he did it without knowing it, that is his problem.",1,1
This trial will be protracted.The defense will likely argue that Sushiro's case is not worth the money because the damages are based on the mere possibility that the boy's actual licking had a negative publicity effect. The defense will argue that the amount of money Sushiro has paid is due to paranoia on Sushiro's part.The defense will likely argue that the actual damages should be limited to what the boy actually licked.,1,1

"As I have written elsewhere, this lawyer's logic is so self-serving, albeit to lighten the defendant's sentence.For example, he says that the replacement of all the dishes in question is excessive, but what if Sushiro had not done so, but had replaced only the bowls that had been perforated? What would have happened if Sushiro had not done so, but instead had replaced only the bowls that had been pelted?I can imagine that customer traffic would not have returned, assets from the lost stock price decline would not have returned, some stores would have been forced out of business, and many employees would have lost their jobs.Even if we focus on just this one thing, I think the defense's argument fails because the plaintiffs can argue that they are justified and that they would have saved the stores from job losses.",1,1
"The video was shocking because it stirred up potential fears such as ""I don't know who will use that teacup"" or ""I don't know whose mouth that sushi went into"". And of course, the person who set it up must have understood that.The person who set it up must have understood that. It was not a direct prank against a friend, but rather a behavior that made people afraid of being seen. They wanted a medal for being a ""big shot"" who had played a prank on an indiscriminate and unspecified number of people. As a result, he was criticized by an unspecified number of people and forced into a situation where he had to take action as a company for an unspecified number of people. The social impact and economic loss were beyond his imagination. It is an extremely malicious and despicable shift of responsibility to take back one's own ignorance and thoughtlessness and claim that it was an overreaction by the recipient.",1,1
"I don't know why you're defending them.You say he was socially sanctioned, but he did something wrong, so he deserved it.The reason for replacing all the bottles was because they could have done it to other bottles, so they had to be hygienic.I don't think the company thinks they're going to get paid.They want to make it known that it's not the time or the company that can just say ""I'm a boy"" or ""I'm sorry"" like they have in the past.",1,1
"This probably won't go all the way to a final judgment.Sushiro is suing in the hopes of raising issues and serving as a deterrent, and not with the intention of driving the boy and his family to the brink of ruin.I suspect that somewhere down the road, a settlement will be reached with the details undisclosed, and both sides will end up settling on a realistic settlement point for both parties.",1,1
"Why don't those who are criticizing Sushiro just pay the boy instead? It is not his own fault that he lost sales and had the bottles replaced. I mean, where's the remorse? You can add compensation on top of it.",1,1
"Yes, there are aspects of that amount of money that surprised me. There is also the aspect of the perpetrator being socially sanctioned. Then what about the victim, Sushiro? What about the damage done to the company and its employees? Who would have thought that the decline in sales and customer traffic was due to that incident? The amount of compensation is large, so I can understand why they are fighting to lower it. I think lawyers should be a little more careful about what they say when they make comments. What would happen if you did that when you do things? That kind of imagination is fundamentally lacking. That's why this incident happened, isn't it? I can understand the feelings of the perpetrators, but it's time for them to change their behavior in this area.",1,1
"As an average citizen, I do not want to go to a restaurant where I can think that there is a soy sauce jug or a teacup that someone might be licking.It does not matter if you are a boy or an elderly person.Even if he was a boy and did not have bad intentions, I think Sushiro's judgment was right.",1,1
"If we can confirm that this action has caused a decrease in customers, people not being able to work their shifts, or closures and closings, can we provide financial guarantees to the families? Also, can you guarantee the mentality of the neighbors against ridicule, etc.?Can you pay the loss to all users if the measures increase the cost and the selling price?Is there any company or organization that would hire or support such a person?If it were me, I would not want to be involved.",1,1
"You can say whatever you want because you think it is someone else's problem. Can the same thing be said from the standpoint of management, which has to protect the safety and security of hundreds or thousands of employees? It is only natural for the perpetrator to feel remorse! After all, there must be a reasonable price to pay for the act.",1,1
"Well, the juvenile side will also make a rebuttal.To say that it is not remorseful to refute is the comment of someone who does not know civil litigation.If you don't refute in a civil suit, you will get a judgment as the plaintiff pleads. I'm sure there will be an increase scheduled in the future, but if 9,000 becomes about 2,000, good luck, and maybe they won't be able to pay it.I am not defending the boy, but this is normal in civil litigation.",1,1
"We make a mistake because we see it as the severity of punishment for sin.The important thing is that people have the concept of defilement.To take an extreme example, no one wants to use a cup that has been filled with feces once, no matter how clean and sterilized it is.That is uncleanness.Sushiro has done what was necessary to clearly demonstrate the elimination of such a sense of disgust and avoidance among customers, and to keep its employees off the street.They deserve to be charged for that.It's not about making them do the dishes or any other form of remorse, and more importantly, I don't care how remorseful the culprit is.The company has the right and responsibility to protect its profits and employees, and has no obligation to offer remorse or guidance to the perpetrator.",1,1
"Because even if you say you have replaced only the bottles in question, you can't dispel the sense of distrust.It is inconveniencing the employees of stores all over the country, and if sales continue to decline and the stores close, how many people will lose their jobs?I think it's true that they didn't expect it to be this big a deal, but it's better not to say anything unnecessary.",1,1
"You're supposed to do a total changeover.We don't know which bottle was licked anymore.I don't know how this boy's side can tell from the same bottle that it's this one.It just happened to be the one time that the video was shown, but he might have done it every time.In order to dispel such concerns, it's only natural to replace all the bottles, and it's also only natural that the number of customers would wane.I think 67 million is a small price to pay for the loss of food safety at conveyor-belt sushi restaurants all over Japan.They should be sorry and compensated for doing something like that with such a light heart.",1,1
"I think we're old enough to judge what not to do, but even adults can't predict if we're going to get burned, because in an age without social networking, we'd be nearly unharmed, so we can't criticize.And this kind of thing will never deter them.I don't know how many years it will take, but I can imagine social networking laws being passed eventually.",1,1
"As an imaginable argument from your position as a responsible parent/guardian who should manage risk, is there any criticism of the actions of the ""friend"" who filmed the Scipero boy's act and transmitted it publicly without any restrictions so that anyone could see it, or of the friend's parents who did not put any restrictions on the phone that the friend had? Is that right?",1,1
"Well, I'm afraid you're going to have to disprove that in order to get a reduction on your claim.I'd like to separate the perjury from the damage caused by the spreading of the perjury.If you're also blamed for the spreading, you can't hope for a reduction in your claim.I'm curious to see how the court will decide the responsibility for the spreading of the perversion and whether they'll go that far.They may come up with a settlement that doesn't show any judgment, but a substantial reduction in terms of social sanctions.I'm interested in that point.",1,1
"I wish you would stop calling him a juvenile. First of all, the fact that he did not come to the store with his guardian indicates that he is responsible. And if he is with his guardian, he should be held responsible. I don't know if it was his intention or his lawyer's, but it is unacceptable to be upset. No longer able to go to school? Did you need a total bottle change? What an aggressive attitude that shows no remorse.Personally, I can't say anything about sales, because they are in flux.There will be more unsolicited videos after this one, and if the plaintiff loses this case, the same kind of people may take advantage of it.",1,1
"Forced to drop out of school→It is up to the individual to attend or drop out of school. Peaceful life was disturbed -> The same goes for Sushiro's customers and employees. There was no intention to spread the word, was it the influencers who spread the word? All of these answers are childish, and the person in question acts as if he or she is the victim. If he had not done such an act in the first place, it would not have happened. He is called a juvenile, but at high school and 18 years old, he is already treated as an adult in Japan. If you are in high school, you should be able to understand the right and wrong of what happened. Sushiro is not filing a claim for damages for money, but to deter similar incidents in the future. Sushiro is doing everything it can to protect its own company. If they just settle out of court, people will wonder if they are really doing their best to ensure sanitation. The damage to Sushiro itself may not be enough, and the impact this incident has had on the public is too great to begin with.",1,1
"Sushiro has been accused many times of bait advertising and bait campaigns, and I believe that the company is not properly governed. There are many problems on the victim's side as well, which is why I think there is a lot of support for the perpetrators.",1,1
"""Rehabilitated by washing dishes, cleaning, and bringing in packages""....Why should Sushiro, the party being inconvenienced, undertake the rehabilitation of the juvenile? Sushiro is not a school or other educational institution. Nor is it a non-profit organization, much less a publicly traded for-profit organization. It is responsible to its shareholders for its performance, and it is only natural that it should file a claim for damages for the harm it has caused.The fact that the boy was expelled from school, and that he is no longer able to lead his daily life as before, were all caused by his own actions and not by Sushiro's intentions.It is not right to say anything to Sushiro about something that has nothing to do with the case.As a result of the boy's actions, Sushiro had no choice but to take measures to protect the safety and security of its stores, such as installing more surveillance cameras and replacing unnecessary bottles. I think the boy should be compensated for that, no matter what he says.",1,1
"Some lawyers are doing their job, so I think the media has a problem with over-reporting as if they are all defending the victim.It's obvious, but I think there are more comments defending the victim and criticizing the perpetrator, so why not cover those?",1,1
"Desecration of food should not be tolerated. There is no doubt about it, and it should be punished.However, was it really necessary to replace all the soy sauce bottles? I think so.Do they usually wipe down soy sauce bottles and other items when they clear the tables after a customer changes?A family member might have used a bottle of soy sauce that had been touched by a sticky family member.Would you be okay with that?The boy's behavior seems to have made me think about that as well.",1,1
"The objection is the lawyer's argument, so the problem lies with the parent who is either throwing the case to the lawyer or setting policy. As long as Sushiro insists on fighting the case in civil and criminal court, there is no way to win, so the worst that can happen is for the parents to sell all of their assets, including their house, and keep only the minimum living expenses and use the rest to compensate for the damages.If the Sushiro side does not take into consideration the basic premise that they are not doing what they want to do but what they are forced to do, they will only make the judge feel worse.",1,1
"I was outraged when I read the article, and I can't believe that the perpetrator would have the nerve to comment on why it was necessary to change all the soy sauce containers, and I can't believe that he is really sorry for what he did.It may have been the idea of the perpetrator's lawyer, but it is only natural that the public would have a strong reaction to such a statement. Even if the lawyer wins his client's case, the assailant's family will live with the finger pointing at them for the rest of their lives. Just because they won the trial, it will only make their lives even more difficult.It is better to argue about something else.Even if you are a minor, you are old enough to understand what you have done.I think it would be better to reflect on what you have done and take the punishment, so the fuss will stop.",1,1
"I stopped going to places where a large number of people, including Sushiro, come in contact with me when people started doing this kind of thing.Well, if you care about it, you shouldn't go there.　I guess the people who defend this can't imagine that the people in front of their seats were licking the soy sauce jug.The reproductive capacity of gum disease bacteria and the bacteria that adhere to it from kissing can be in the tens of millions of germs.Those who advocate for them probably have normal immune systems, so they won't care, but if someone with a compromised immune system gets them in their system, the bacteria will multiply, increasing the likelihood of complications leading to the development of the disease. The same is true for people being treated for leukemia or for people being treated for cancer.",1,1
It is clear that he is not sorry when he makes these claims in court in the first place.They probably think it was just bad luck and that they will do better next time.I don't think there is any room for rehabilitation.He needs to be thoroughly punished to make an example out of him.,1,1
"The claim is too subtle to ignore.There's only one bottle that the boy licked, so in effect the damage must be done for one or, if unknown, a narrower list of candidates.If you did some measures in all the stores, then it's not the boy's crime, but someone else's, and the boy is being held accountable for the crime that someone else may have committed.",1,1
"This trial is meant to be a social deterrent, and if the judge makes the wrong decision, it will only create an atmosphere where the only way to deal with the situation is to make heavy laws to deal with the situation.The judge is an elitist, and he/she has a taste for public sentiment and business, and the possibility that he/she will accept the fact that he/she is a juvenile and what the defense is claiming is true is frightening.If the judge does not award much compensation, some people will try to copy him, and the restaurant industry will become a risky and difficult one, causing social turmoil.However, left-leaning judges may not care.I beg you to award at least 10 million in damages, because it will deter them a little. It would deter them a little.",1,1
"Even Sushiro's side does not expect to win the full amount of the claim. Whether the amount of compensation is appropriate or not is a matter for discussion after the verdict is made.In a sense, it is an expression of will from the same kind of industry that they will not cry and sleep over this kind of nuisance.The expulsion was simply to make it harder for the student to stay in school, not out of remorse. If he had not been sued for compensation, he might have continued to pretend to be a celebrity.",1,1
"The reason why they replaced all the bottles is one of the ways to restore the damaged corporate image.I mean, Sushiro is not the only one who has made some kind of change, such as individually wrapping chopsticks or not putting sauces on tables, and the amount of damage done to the restaurant industry must be unimaginable, but it is impossible to argue against it.",1,1
"For criminal acts, even if underage.should be decided by a civil court or a huge compensation.If rehabilitation or a minor is used as a reason to reduce a sentence, there will probably be more copycats.there will probably be more copycats in the future.Sushiro as a company should fight with the offender in court for a long time.Sushiro as a company should fight with the juvenile perpetrator in a long term trial.",1,1
"He is a minor, right?If you do it, the perpetrator is not the boy, but his guardian. Also, since a large company was operating without anticipating the wrongful act of a minor, they are responsible for it. I think it is strange to speak as if the juvenile is entirely responsible.",1,1
"I am sure there are at least a few people who, after seeing the Sushipero video, will think to themselves, ""I'm going to stop eating at Sushiro for the time being,"" so I am sure there will be damage.It would be better if this case becomes more famous with high compensation, so that if someone tries to do a similar act, his friends will stop him and say, ""Hey, don't do it, it'll end your life. It should be over 100 million.",1,1
"This is a statement by the juvenile's attorney, so it is not an option.It is his duty to defend him.But to defend him in the general public is insane or unhygienic.Expulsion from high school.""For a boy to do such an outrageous thingIs it so unacceptable?He is already enrolled in another high school.and it's not like he has been deprived of the means to learn or anything.It is an interruption of a peaceful life.""Who would think that a peaceful life could continue after all of this?Perhaps no one thinks that they can continue to live a peaceful life after all of this.""Destroy all bottles.""If the boy could prove that he did not lick the bottles, he would not be able to do so.But there is no way that they could do that.Even if the bottles in that seat could be identifiedEven if the bottles on the table could be identified, the customer's feelings would not be satisfied.",1,1
"This kind of rebuttal reaffirms to me that it is better to properly claim damages.I think this case should be added to the dictionary's entry for ""thieves and thugs.The decline in sales of the conveyor-belt sushi industry is due in no small part to the bait-and-switch advertising problem, the power harassment case, and the espionage case, but these are not the same thing, and what needs to be done must be done.",1,1
"In the past, a prank between classmates would be settled by a teacher or an adult in the neighborhood who would be very angry with the prankster, or by washing dishes, but suddenly it becomes a nationwide prank. I think it is necessary to have an example of compensation for damages in order to make people understand what it means. The freedom to transmit information via SNS is appealing, but I think it is necessary to be imaginative about how a third party will perceive what you have posted. When you think about it, social networking is a very heavy thing.",1,1
"When I posted the video, it was someone else who spread the word.I don't know how you can say that...And, Sushiro, etc.If a company does this, they will really fight.I guess they thought that if they didn't put up a stance that they would fight, it wouldn't lead to safe eating,I don't think it can be helped.Even if Sushiro had wanted to forgive them, it would have been difficult for the company to be lenient in its response.",1,1
"I think if you don't read the current trends, there's even a possibility of a higher award for the assailant's.I guess it is a matter of the skill of the lawyer though, since it is the lawyer who makes the strategy.As for the trial, there could be a benchmark ruling for similar crimes in the future. It could go all the way to the Supreme Court if it's not good enough unless they settle.",1,1
"Isn't it his own attitude that made Sushiro's response so severe?I can only judge from the news reports, but at least as far as I can tell, there is no indication that he is sincerely sorry, and even at this stage, he is making what seems to be a sophomoric argument to escape responsibility.Also, some people defend him because he is still a child, but that is the same as saying that the parents should take responsibility, which does not mean that there is no guilt.",1,1
"I knew I wasn't the only one who didn't want to go to Sushiro because of that incident. I don't want to take my family or loved ones there either.However, Sushiro is on the victim's side and is only doing what it can as a store to ensure a sanitary environment.I feel that the boy's opinion is self-serving and childish.",1,1
"I understand what the boy is trying to say, but you have to prove it yourself if your competitors are affected. There is no point in just speculating against them. They should also understand that they are causing a lot of trouble to the employees working at Sushiro. There are an increasing number of people who want to give Sushiro a bad name by tampering with Sushiro under the influence of the boys' pranks. Employees now have to explain and apologize for every single thing they do. The dropping out of high school and the impact it has had on their lives is rust from their own bodies. The decision to drop out of high school was ultimately made by me. If she had endured the needle's eye view, she would have graduated. There are unfortunate people who say they feel sorry for you, but can you eat or use dishes, cups, or condiments that have spit, phlegm, snot, stain, or hair on them from someone you don't know? I'd like to ask the opposite. Besides, there are employees who were not able to work due to the boy's influence and their salaries were affected. There are many employees who have had their salaries reduced, including the restaurant being closed. You should know that there are many parts of the actual damage that are not being reported!",1,1
"There's a lot of talk about juvenile rehabilitation.But in Japan, punitive damagesIn Japan, punitive damages are notpunitive damages are not allowed in Japan.In addition, it is the shareholders, not the company, who have sufferedthe shareholders, not the company, right?So, in the endI wonder if the judgment will be in the millions.The only defendant in this lawsuit is the boy.I thought that the parents would also be involved as protective supervisors.I thought so.So there is no chance of recovery.It seems to be a full-blown show-and-tell lawsuit.",1,1
"In the first place, they should be aware of how much trouble their prank videos usually cause to the public, and furthermore, as high school students, they should be fully aware of this.It is impossible to ask them to believe that they did not intend to spread the video.The ethical standards of the perpetrator are problematic, but shouldn't the parents who raised the boy also be considered a problem in terms of their parenting ethics?",1,1
"＞I was forced to withdraw from school. I think that high school students should have a code of ethics that would prohibit them from doing something stupid like this. Since this is what happens because they don't have such a code of ethics, they should be penalized for it.I think it would be very kind of Sushiro to take action to restore trust in hygiene at all Sushiro stores, and to pay 60 million yen per store since it cost 100,000 yen per store.They talk about volunteer activities, but volunteer activities have not taken root as an everyday activity in Japan. Volunteer activities are just a way of exposing the defendant, so what do you think? I hope that the defendant will receive a proper verdict and face the situation squarely. I don't think the atonement will last a lifetime because no one died, so I hope he will take his life seriously this time.",1,1
The public welfare should take precedence over the rehabilitation of the perpetrator. I think this is a case where private rights can also be limited. The judiciary should accept responsibility for damages and work to restore order as soon as possible. That is the role of the judiciary.,1,1
"I am not defending the boy at all.On the other hand, as a risk hedge for the company, we could have identified the possibility that some customers would commit such acts.Even chopsticks can be licked and put back together.I understand that there may be difficulties in terms of cost and operation, but I would like you to consider hedging your risks.",1,1
"The issue is not about replacing the whole shoyu bottle, but the act of causing trouble for the restaurant. It is not okay to do anything because they are minors. Isn't it necessary to curb the recurrence and nuisance in the future? Learning ethics should be taught by parents, not by schools.",1,1
"I personally support Sushiro's stance of not letting up and pursuing this.I think this is necessary to ensure the safety of the restaurant industry and its users.The juvenile side has every right to make their case, so please feel free to do so.But let's not forget that there is still public interest in this story and attention is focused on their every move.Now all that remains is for the court to make a decision.",1,1
"It's just an anachronism for the media to try to bring it to the boy's defense.In reality, the number of voices defending the boy is very small.In general, there is something wrong with the decisions of Japanese courts.They have only awarded compensation that deviates from the actual amount of damages.The supremacy of precedents is outdatedAs the times change, we should change our standards.",1,1
"I hope Sushiro will do its best for its future, because a firm large compensation claim here would be a good opportunity to curb future nuisances to the food and beverage industry.",1,1
"These nuisances are a challenge to the restaurant industry and if they lose this battle, restaurants will cry themselves to sleep forever. It will be desperate for the restaurant industry to suffer tremendous damage from rampant nuisance behavior. Of course, the biggest potential victims are the consumers who will not be able to receive the services they take for granted.",1,1
"This may be an unavoidable expression as a rebuttal to the trial, but it would probably be the worst thing that could happen to the general public's impression. As I mentioned in a comment on another article, this kind of rebuttal does not reflect ""remorse,"" but rather ""regret"" at being asked to pay a large amount of compensation.It would be nice if, once they accept the verdict, they could settle with Sushiro for a reduced amount so that the public won't know, but I guess that's impossible.",1,1
"It is doubtful that he is remorseful.When posting on social networking sites, it is clear that the intention is to spread the news as much as possible and to let people know about it. Basically, social networking sites are used for this purpose. Blaming it on influencers, or the fact that it is unpredictable, makes no sense.Regardless of how much money is involved, I would like to see a thorough fight.Even if they call me a scapegoat, I can't help but feel that I am being held accountable for my actions.",1,1
"Why did you replace all the bottles?"" The reason is to allay the customers' fears. Of course, that won't wipe out all the customers, but if you don't appeal that you are doing what you can as a restaurant industry, you won't get any customers back.And as for the ""I was forced to drop out of high school,"" that may be considered a criminal offense, but it has nothing to do with civil cases. It is compensation for the damage done to Sushiro.",1,1
"If we let loose just because they are juveniles, I don't think these things will ever go away or decrease. In this case, the social impact is especially great. I think they should be punished firmly. I think we should also give him a name. If you don't do anything wrong, there's nothing to be done.",1,1
"Since they disregarded the existence of cutlery and seasonings, which are provided on the basis of a good nature, and acted in a manner that made customers feel uneasy across the entire food service industry, they deserve to be compensated for their damages.If the major chains do not take the lead, there will be no lawsuits for small and medium-sized businesses, and the only options for them will be to cry themselves to sleep or go out of business.",1,1
"In the manufacturing industry, when there is a problem in the production process of one product, it is called ""horizontal expansion"" to check for similar problems in the production process of other products and take countermeasures if there is a possibility.Replacing all bottles is a part of ""horizontal expansion. It is not surprising if all chopsticks are replaced.It's a heck of a way to reduce the amount of money.",1,1
"It is a big mistake to be lenient on this nuisance because they are juveniles! Without legal changes, the business is only holding up because it is Sushiro, but if it were a small or medium-sized business, it would be on the verge of bankruptcy or insolvency.For the sake of the boy and to eliminate such people in the future, Sushiro should win the case and be paid the desired amount of compensation.If this is overturned, the boy will not grow up to be a good adult, and I don't think the nuisance will decrease in the future.Remember, this is a crime!",1,1
"I don't think the Sushiro side is serious about taking 67 million from the boy.I think their goal is to make the public understand the seriousness of the prank that was done with a light heart and to let the public know about it, and they will reduce the amount of compensation after the amount of compensation is determined in court.",1,1
"It is really difficult to claim damages.For example, if an ambulance is involved in an accident and the hospital is delayed in arriving and the person it was carrying is lost.Ambulance alone => Can the driver be held responsible for the accident?Accident caused by another car => Can the driver be held responsible for the death of the person?Also, if the person who died was a great person and there was a big damage.In short, how much compensation is given to the secondary matters in relation to the main damage?",1,1
"If Sushiro pulls back here, the ""unscrupulous people who want to show off"" will be energized.We need to make sure that society as a whole takes reasonable responsibility for any behavior that inconveniences others.",1,1
"I think it's because they are social evils, but if that's the case, shouldn't there be a trend to make them pay more in the future for the crimes they commit against juvenile delinquents, bikers, and other violent crimes such as murder? This case is too childish, but when the result of the crime is the bankruptcy of the parents, I can't say anything about it.　Oh, I see...individuals are fighting against big business and powerful people, so I guess I have to side with the juvenile, not that I'm a judge's advocate.",1,1
"That video was horrifying and it's important to let people know that it's that severely bad, but I think it's a bit much now. That's why I've kind of stopped going into stores lately when I see them lol. I feel as if the company is trying to permanently erase the family members from society. I wonder if the public will change its opinion of the company at once if they get killed in the heart.You've seen enough to know that this is a bad idea and that this is what will happen if the companies get serious about it. The problem of manners and ethics that led to this behavior, apart from the actual damage, is that along with the rapid evolution of the Internet, the country as an adult has not been prepared in the area of education.",1,1
"If they had not found out, there would not have been such a big fuss. This is a self-serving logic.I don't have to go to the store where the defendant did this without hesitation, or even to the store and take a survey myself.How can we be sure that there are no people on the same level as the defendant who watched this video and imitated it?Can the defendant and his lawyer come to the store and eat the food licked by people who do not know what kind of health condition they are in without any hesitation?They were forced to drop out of high school and otherwise prevented from leading a peaceful life.They still do not realize the gravity of what they have done and have not reflected on what they have done. In the U.S., the cost would be two orders of magnitude higher. I should be glad that I only had to pay this amount of money.",1,1
"I personally think that age has nothing to do with the criminal act of distributing a video, which could be taken as an attempt to spread the message, and that appropriate measures should be taken.",1,1
"If Sushiro conducted a survey to see if I stopped going because of the boy's behavior, I'd say yes.And if Sushiro were to conduct a survey to find out if I stopped going because of the boy's behavior, I would answer ""yes"" as well.I'd rather Sushiro do that kind of survey, and I'm sure they'd get a lot of responses defending the Sushiro side.In response to that, the boy's lawyer could do the same kind of survey.I'd like to see a trial that puts consumer awareness at the forefront, and I hope the juvenile side loses badly to prevent similar cases from happening.",1,1
"If you're really spending your days in reflection, you won't write a rebuttal in your answer.Why did you replace all the bottles?It was to prove, in the store's own way, a bit of safety and trust to the other public customers.Was his peaceful life disturbed?The boy's actions are disrupting not only the restaurant, but also other customers' ability to eat 'safely' and 'normally.In the past, private restaurants were forced to close due to incidents like this, and in the end, some of them committed suicide due to the shock.Before questioning the restaurant's treatment and handling of the boy, please think about the crime you have committed and the impact it has had on you before you speak out.",1,1
"How can you think that washing dishes or carrying in luggage will give them a chance to rehabilitate themselves? Even if you do that, the store staff and customers will say, ""That's what happened in the case,"" and the victim will say, ""Why is the victim giving the perpetrator a free pass? Why would the victim give the perpetrator a break?Why not just get a job outside of Sushiro as a dishwasher or baggage handler and use the salary to repay the compensation?",1,1
"If they had done it quietly, they would have only been offended. But now that the video has spread around the world, the damage is immeasurable.I have to say that it is right to replace them in order to wipe out their image.",1,1
"It is understandable to defend the perpetrator with respect to criminal punishment in the hope that he will be rehabilitated.However, it is wrong to defend the perpetrator even in the case of civil damages.It is a legitimate right for the victim to claim compensation from the perpetrator for the harm he or she has suffered.",1,1
"If the claim for damages is not approved, a rival company with malicious intent can use the boy to cause reputational damage. Sixty million is too lenient.You have threatened thousands of people's jobs and tens of thousands of people's food, so you must be prepared to not complain even if they do the same to you.A bill of more than one billion dollars is not enough.",1,1
"Even if the problem does not spread to all Sushiro stores, people who worked at those stores (including part-timers) may lose their jobs due to the closure, and the company may lose money, but I think the problem is that the perpetrator cannot guarantee the income of those people. This could lead to some people being impoverished. I think this time it was meant as an example, but I hope this will reduce the number of foolish acts.By the way, I wonder if the people who were laughing together and taking videos are not to blame?",1,1
"The fact is that you have caused damage by exposing your foolish acts to the Internet. It is clear that an apology is not enough. The boy's expulsion from high school and loss of a peaceful life is inevitable and self-inflicted. It has nothing to do with compensation for damages.Prosecution is essential to deter similar crimes. Sushiro will suffer substantial damages as a result, since he has no ability to pay anyway.",1,1
"I don't know what's going on inside, but visits were down not only at Sushiro, but at conveyor-belt sushi restaurants as a whole. Around the time of my imagination, there was usually a line for sure, but there was a rattle.People who defend this have too little business sense.This may have affected suppliers who lost sales, part-timers who got fired, employees who didn't get higher salaries, and many other things. No one can guarantee the livelihood of these people.It's still a good thing that it's a big company, but if it were a private store, it would have gone out of business.There used to be a buckwheat noodle shop nearby that had a part-time job terror, but it went out of business, and I really felt sorry for them.",1,1
"I say this is the kind of development that happens when you have the full force of the unseemliness of a trial running away from compensation at all costs.　Forced to drop out of high school? Does that become a matter of rebuttal because of Sushi Pero? And replacing all the bottles is a rebuttal?　It's a mess.　The boy's actions (video) will not disappear, and in order to dispel any reputational damage, replacing all the bottles is a desperate measure to dispel even the slightest bit of the tarnished image.　And since he could have taken a leave of absence or transferred to another school when he dropped out of high school, he was forced to drop out of school, which makes him sound like a victim. I'm confused.　Prevention of imitation is also necessary.If this case does not result in high compensation, and people get away with it, I think that in the future there will even be copycats in the direction of avoiding compensation in court for unsolicited videos (actions that damage companies and their stock prices).",1,1
"I know this boy's lawyer has to do his job.What's written in the pleadings is unreasonable.If the decline in stock price was caused by a competitor's storeIf the decline in stock price was caused by other competing stores, the evidence should be clearly stated as a numerical value.Also, the boy's lawyer says that he did not intend to spread the rumor, so the influencer spread the rumor.If it is the influencer's fault, the boy should sue the influencer, not Sushiro.The boy was expelled from school because he was a nuisance, and if he had not been a nuisance, he would not have had to be expelled from school.Also, it seems to me that the boy is saying that he caused the nuisance, but he is not going to pay for the damages, not as if he is suing for a reduction of the damages.The juvenile doesn't understand the gravity of the situation.",1,1
"Civil trials for criminal damage in Japan overly protect the perpetrators and neglect the rights of the victims.The most egregious example of this is a bullying death case.The accused juveniles (plural) were found ""not guilty of delinquency"" by a lenient trial by the juvenile court (family court), and the case was decided.However, in a civil trial for damages, the court reversed the verdict, and the judgment of payment of compensation (guilty) became final and binding.However, some of the perpetrators (including the guardians) have absconded and have not paid the compensation, and the lawyers for the perpetrators have refused to reveal the whereabouts of the absconding perpetrators, claiming ""false charges. As a result, the victim's family has been forced to continue to go to court, etc., to seek payment (seizure, etc.) with great effort in order to avoid the statute of limitations.The same thing could happen in this Sushiro case, even if a judgment for payment of compensation is reached.",1,1
"That's right, would you leave the bottle in place if you didn't know which seat it was in? I think it is the responsibility of the service industry to change everything. We have to ensure the safety and security of our customers. And you can't say it's a competitive factor. On the contrary, would you still go to Sushiro after this incident? I would like to ask you.",1,1
"The principle of the rule of law is to take responsibility for what you have done. Although there are limits to an individual's capacity for compensation, it is not up to outsiders to decide whether the amount of money claimed is right or wrong. The media should be aware of this and report on it, but they are too stupid to do anything but make inflammatory statements. The only way is for each individual to have a firm standard of judgment.",1,1
"It may not be a big deal to the boy, but nowadays you never know what will be posted on social networking sites, and it is normal to foresee such things. This discussion is only going on because Sushiro is still strong enough to stay in business, but what if it leads to a decrease in customers and the company goes out of business? How much trouble will it cause to the employees, their families, and shareholders? It's too late to regret it.",1,1
"It was the boy's action that started the incident in the first place, and if it had not been for that, the boy would have been able to lead a peaceful life, so it is only natural that the boy should take full responsibility for his actions.I wish the media would make a documentary on what happened to the boy and his family after an incident like this.",1,1
"If you're asking why I replaced all the bottles, or something like that, from Sushiro's point of view.Why didn't he quit high school?From Sushiro's point of view, he wouldn't have told this perpetrator to quit school, he wouldn't know.If he was expelled from school without wanting to, that would be between Peropero boy and the school. If he left voluntarily, that would be his own decision, so it would have nothing to do with Sushiro.",1,1
">As for the issue of reputational issues in terms of hygiene, he denies any relationship with the juvenile's conduct, saying that it is ""the extremely subjective psychology of consumers,If this statement is true, the defense's argument is that ""people who saw the video on the Internet spread bad impressions on their own, based on their own subjective viewpoints. This is because the boy's act was not intended to spread the message.This would definitely be a shift of responsibility. If the boy himself feels the same way, he is definitely not sorry. He is just atrophied because of the fuss.If this is a harmless ruling and no longer has the nature of a ""sanction,"" I wonder if ""peropero"" will be this year's popular word of the year. Some comedians may do something similar as their ""art"". It seems that there are already people who have done the act of putting sushi on their opponents' faces in martial arts competitions. I shudder to think what the future holds if the defense side's argument is accepted.",1,1
"If you have a lawyer who encourages you to develop logic that is too unreasonable...""All of the restaurants in the conveyor-belt sushi industry should join togetherThe company should sue him for damages for disrupting the conveyor-belt sushi business model.Of course, the companies were forced to deal with the situation, so they should also sue for actual damages.Frankly, I understand that lawyers are supposed to protect defendants and that it is their duty to do so, but it is not in line with public sentiment to develop a fictitious logic that is sure to arouse animosity.I think many people feel that the current court system is wrong, including the sentences.",1,1
I think the boy being sued should file a civil suit against his friends who shot the video and put it on the internet for half of the damages once the amount of compensation is fixed. I think the crime and the punishment are about the same.,1,1
"Walls have ears and shoji screens have eyes. If you do something in a public place, someone is watching you and it will be recorded on a surveillance camera. If someone sees it, it will be posted on social networking sites, and social networking sites will spread. It doesn't matter if it's among friends or not. It is only natural that you have to take full responsibility when you do something that is disturbing.In this day and age, if someone is doing something annoying or illegal right in front of you, the safest and surest thing to do is to take a picture and upload it to a social networking site without saying a word, rather than to directly warn the person and risk getting involved or being resented. The police will give out personal information more easily than you think, so you can't trust them, and they may ask you to overlook the situation.I applaud taking a risk to help someone, but it shouldn't be required. Everyone has a life to protect, and not everyone can afford to do it all the time, so the act of filming and spreading the word should be tolerated, and the party causing the inconvenience should take full responsibility for any damage that results.",1,1
"Sushiro was originally defenseless against malicious intent, right?It is not right to put the boy on the hook for the full cost of the countermeasures.It is natural that they should be compensated for the damage, but the capital investment is not just a loss, but an asset that will be useful in the future.If Sushiro's claim is approved in full, Sushiro's balance would not be plus or minus zero, but a big plus.For example, it would be strange if Sushiro were to claim damages against a single shoplifter for the cost of capital investment in surveillance cameras and other equipment used to prevent shoplifting.",1,1
"The severity of the crime should be determined by the magnitude of the damage, not the magnitude of the malice of the perpetrator.If the lesser the malice, the lesser the crime, then is the crime of the person who lightly placed a stone on a railroad track or the person who lightly tried to set fire to a building less serious?",1,1
"In the first place, a civil case is neither to punish nor to atone for a crime. It is a trial to compensate for the damage inflicted.Neither ""the damage inflicted has decreased because the juvenile has shown remorse"" nor ""the damage has decreased because the juvenile has been socially sanctioned"" are valid in Japanese.The reason why the damages are small in this type of case is that the cost of ""taking measures in response to the incident"" is not a direct damage, but involves a positive action on the part of the plaintiff taken out of a business decision. On the other hand, while almost no one in the world has ever publicized their own crimes, the publicity was so great that Sushiro had to take immediate countermeasures or face possible bankruptcy.We look forward to seeing what kind of verdict will be issued in light of the fact that the video was uploaded to the Internet and can be viewed by people all over the world.",1,1
"As long as you don't know where you're doing the same thing, it's only natural to implement it, just not spreading the 'why did you replace all the bottles'.And since it's inevitable that customers will think, 'This one might be licked too,' we just implemented it to prevent that thought from happening.If you complain about the amount of money, then 'don't do what you don't have to do'.",1,1
"When you let them record an unsolicited video, you're out of the game.They must have been driven to the point where they had to replace the bottles as well.I think the court could add more to the damage award to 100 or 200 million. I think the people who recorded it are just as guilty. I think the influencers who spread the word have a certain amount of responsibility.I think they are putting what they did on the shelf and saying that they are equal to other companies in the industry.",1,1
"If you were remorseful, you wouldn't be arguing.You have no idea how much your actions have affected society.You can't change the fact that you posted the video in the first place.If a person who can do that with impunity is sorry for what he did, he wouldn't even think of doing it in the first place.If there is no blame for this, then the boy can do whatever he wants.",1,1
"I was wondering why they still do this kind of thing after so much talk about byte terrorism, and not only this criminal, but other people who do the same kind of thing...I look at the wide area robbers and the blackout jobbers, and I feel that no matter how much I explain the risks and such, there are many people who just don't get it.",1,1
"I really don't know why you are defending the perpetrator.You have to take responsibility for what you did.I don't know how much damage Sushiro has suffered from this incident....If Sushiro doesn't make some kind of claim that they changed all the bottles, they won't get any customers back.What else should they do?I think they did the right thing by replacing all the bottles, disinfecting, etc.I don't know if the perpetrators are really sorry for what they did. The fact that they're so willing to argue (unless their lawyers are saying so themselves).In extreme cases, why don't the people who defend him pay him? You are defending what the perpetrator did, right?",1,1
"I don't understand the sense of those who defend the boy's side.I think this kind of problem has caused a lot of damage, including sanitation, loss of the company's image, and stock price.Would you want to go to a restaurant where someone would do something like that?In other words, I think it means that they have been made to be that kind of restaurant.It is quite difficult to recover such an image.",1,1
"When you put a video on a social networking site, ""don't expect it to spread"" won't work.I think the court will decide that ""it was foreseeable that others would spread the video.The perpetrator's lawyer is in a lot of pain.As for ""discarding and replacing all the soy sauce bottles,"" the possibility that similar actions were taken outside of the video cannot be ruled out, so it is reasonable to act based on the restaurant's sanitary standards.",1,1
"If he hadn't been such a nuisance, you wouldn't have had to expel him, and you wouldn't have had to leave school. And his family would have been fine.The question I would like to ask the perpetrator is, would you be able to eat normally at the restaurant where the disturbance took place? Wouldn't you feel a little safer if they said that everything had been replaced? I don't think they're saying they didn't think the video would go viral, or that they regret what they did.It's obvious that you're trying to reduce the amount of compensation.Parents should take full responsibility. I think Sushiro's response is reasonable.",1,1
"When you post something on a social networking site, it is a manifestation of ""the desire to show it to an unspecified number of others. It is impossible to say, ""I don't expect it to spread.I also recognized that there was such a risk, at least for me, because of this sushi terrorist attack, and I refrained from visiting the restaurant.I was surprised to see this kind of defense.",1,1
"The reason why the sender defends the perpetrator is because that side is more familiar to the recipient. In this case, in particular, the perpetrator is a minor, so he is responsible for his family, and he is trying to gain support by encouraging the public to avoid the anxiety that ""I, too, may be charged a large amount of money for something I cannot control, such as my child. This is an attempt to gain support from the public. They may also see this as a good opportunity to stir up confrontation with inconvenient customers by spouting ""those bloodless people on the Internet are laughing and laughing at the boy being ripped to shreds"".However, I think you should take into account that the defense's opinion is only a court-appointed job, and that the lawyer's opinion does not = the perpetrator's opinion. It may just be that the lawyer has found some motivation to bite off so much more than he thought.",1,1
"Of course, there needs to be an opinion that takes the juvenile's side, and I don't take that lightly.However, there is one thing about the content of this article that I cannot overlookAs for ""why did you replace all the bottles?""That's just a corporate effort.I think it is a false accusation to think that the boy is disadvantaged in any way by this.",1,1
"No, wait a minute.This is a trial, so it is only natural for both sides, the plaintiff and the defendant, to tell their side of the story. It is not for us to judge them, but for the judge to judge them. The media should have the good sense to appeal to the public that we are not at the stage of condemning this boy because of what public opinion is saying.What worries me is that the natural ""defense"" language in the trial will be taken out of the courtroom and into the well of public opinion by the media, which will put strong pressure on the boy and obstruct the progress of the trial. It is inexcusable that private punishment is being invisibly inflicted on the juvenile in a forum where legal compensation is being discussed, but not in a forum where it is not.And it is even more incomprehensible that the media is taking the lead in this. Reporting the facts is fine, but please don't put a bias on them to inflame public opinion.",1,1
"I personally stopped going to conveyor belt sushi restaurants, including Sushiro.I don't want to be a copycat.When I go into a restaurant, I don't want to use anything that has the possibility of being tampered with.I think I care too much, but I can't help it.I hope the victim company will fight the case thoroughly, and I hope the court will give them a harsh sentence.",1,1
"I am not inclined to defend this boy at all.However, we do need to separate the trial from the ethical issues. Trials tend to be averse to excitements.In the future, the juvenile's possible claims areExpelled from school and socially sanctioned -> hardly relevant since it is a claim for damages.Decreased sales are a competitive factor -> That may be, but the actual cost of loss is 67 million.Why didn't they stop handling the product on TV→They continued to consider social responsibility.It was spread by influencers on YouTube, but why didn't they stop it and let it be spread? →Why didn't you stop it?The reason is that they kept letting it spread, so they had to change it in all stores.I think that the court cost will be less than 5 million yen, including the cost of 67 million yen for stamps and other court costs.",1,1
"While there is indeed an opportunity for argument, it makes me angry to hear the counter-argument wWhat would not have happened if you had not gone the extra mile in the first place.Lawyers are full of theories that they come up with in their heads, and to try to shift the conversation to only the two parties, the boy and Sushiro, as ""the other side did it on their own"" is out of touch with the public's sensibilities, as it is a matter of hygiene that Sushiro has suffered from and that customers feel uneasy about.While the boy is reflecting on his actions and leading a social life as an adult, he will be labeled as ""having obstructed business, but without any remorse, he was out of line"".I don't think it's good for the boy's future to only try to win the game in front of him.",1,1
"If they claim that sales decreased due to lack of sales efforts, the defense will have to prove that only sales at competing stores other than Sushiro increased before and after the Perot incident (and other food terrorism).Perhaps, on the contrary, they will come up with data showing a decrease in sales for the industry as a whole.More importantly, the Perot family should be able to show that the ""friend who took the video,"" the ""friend who stood up to the music,"" and the ""friend who posted it on social networking sites"" are not the only ones who should be compensated.Share in the payment of compensation, oror file a civil lawsuit against them for taking responsibility for filming and posting the pero act.",1,1
"It's an anachronism to think that you can publish something on a social networking site and not expect it to spread. If you put something on a social networking site to get the word out, and it does get out as expected, it's just an insane act that shakes up society.Social sanctions are also a result of one's actions. However, because you received social sanctions, there are extenuating circumstances for a criminal case. Even if you are exempted from criminal proceedings, you can still sue for civil damages, of course.The amount of damages is also a natural amount considering the causal relationship because of the impact on a company that operates nationwide in Japan.",1,1
"Normally, if you think about it, everything that is served in a restaurant that you are free to use, you can't help but overreact to the fact that if you serve it to a customer, they might think that you are going to get dirty.Because the soy sauce was slurped down, but the other items were served under the same conditions.If that were the case, I would be suspicious not only of that restaurant, but of all the same items in the chain.It just happened to be Sushiro, but other restaurants in the same chain may have been hit as well.What about ramen and buffet restaurants?Considering the fact that the restaurant did something that could have resulted in compensation from all the other restaurants in Japan, we should be relieved that it only cost that amount of money.Impressions are important, so it is inevitable to think that similar conditions = the same thing is being done to you, and if they say so, you have no choice but to exchange or discard the product.You may want to lower the price as much as possible, but I think it's fair.You have to hate yourself for having done it rather than hate the world.",1,1
"Punishment for the boy is another story, but Sushiro's customers were reduced in the first place because of the two violations of the Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations.I think Sushiro was helped in the end by the fact that it became the victim in this case.In fact, fewer people have been exposed to the violations.",1,1
"The lawsuit was filed to have the existence of liability and the amount of compensation determined impartially according to the judiciary, and it is wrong to criticize them for that.The defendant is free to argue that neither ""expulsion from high school (voluntary expulsion, not expulsion by the school)"" nor ""disruption of a peaceful life"" had anything to do with the damage to Sushiro's side.It would be strange if a civil claim for damages is reduced on the basis of extenuating circumstances.",1,1
"Since it is a lawsuit, if the plaintiff's complaint is refuted, it should just be challenged in court. I believe that you have received certain social sanctions, but the extent of the damage and the compensation for it should be indicated under the judiciary. You have intentionally caused damage, and you have caused a great deal of trouble to society.",1,1
"They should visit Sushiro stores all over the country with their own money, increase the number of views while getting down on their knees and paying compensation with their earnings. A bank book must be opened every month so that viewers can monitor to see if the income from the views is being used for other purposes. Even after the payment is completed, they will be required to make a donation to Sushiro for the rest of their lives.",1,1
"The sophistry of these juveniles and their lawyers is a perfect example of today's Japanese society. Young people who do not care about others and are not afraid to harm others by applying for a part-time job in the dark. This boy is no different. Japanese youths are lawless, trying to make money by having fun, or to get some kind of profit by standing out. We need to educate them better, including corporal punishment. Under the current situation where teachers can do nothing no matter what, juvenile crime will continue to increase. Youth crime will continue to increase.",1,1
"Restaurants are built on trust, so they should not tolerate any inconvenience from customers.Large chain restaurants are especially vulnerable.There is no point in going along with the excuses of the perpetrators.The actual behavior is extremely unsanitary,It is only natural that the number of customers would be affected.The company's claim for compensation is also small.The claim for compensation as a company is also small.",1,1
"Just because the boy was licking the bottles doesn't increase the probability that bottles from other restaurants were licked, does it? I don't understand why you think Sushiro as a whole is in danger because that video went viral.It's quite possible that similar incidents have occurred at other restaurants as well, just because the video hasn't gone viral, and Sushiro's video just happened to go viral. If you want to say that the boy has discredited Sushiro, you would need to have a significant increase in the number of people committing similar acts at Sushiro due to the boy's influence.",1,1
"Why did they switch?Because they might have done it every time they came to the restaurant and sat in a different seat, in addition to the video that was shown,Or maybe it's because they collect soy sauce from the various seats and distribute it to the people in the restaurant when they replenish the soy sauce.The video has made the conveyor-belt sushi chain lose a lot of credibility, and even the restaurants not involved in the incident were temporarily rattled at a time when they are usually packed.In fact, I might be sued by someone other than Sushiro.I guess I'd have to defend them, but it's almost like an accusation after all I've done.A trial is not something that ends with ""I admit it and I'm sorry. I wonder if it can't end with that, and if I have to do something to get out of it.I don't get a good impression.",1,1
"In order to restore the image and trust of our customers, we have decided to close all of our stores and reopen them under a new name, and we ask that you compensate us for that.""It was a good thing that the soy sauce bottles were replaced.",1,1
"The lawyer representing the juvenile is also in a difficult position and may have no choice.On the other hand, it may be an argument that may increase the amount of damages.I'm almost certain that he will lose the case anyway, even if the amount is reduced, but since you can't pay what you don't have, the only thing left to do is to file for bankruptcy.That would be the end of the atonement for the acts done.",1,1
"If they hadn't done this act in the first place, they just wouldn't have been punished.Sushiro needs to make up the loss in order to restore the company to its former state and protect the lives of its employees.It may have been a careless act, and it may have been done for fun, but please think about the many people who have suffered because of it.It is not only you and your children who are suffering.If you say you are sorry, why are you giving incomprehensible explanations and acting like a victim?You should be honest and compensate for the damages.",1,1
"And ""sufficient"" social sanctions.too ""excessive"" is only subjective, based on this person's personal opinion, and is nowhere objective.and there is no objectivity in them.Sushiro doesn't think so at all, and I don't think so either.I don't think so either. How much does he represent the opinion of the Japanese people as a whole?How much does he represent the opinions of the Japanese people as a whole?How much more representative of the opinions of the Japanese people as a whole than the ""opinions"" of a reporter, a critic, a stranger, who has suffered no damage at all?Sushiro's opinion is more important than the ""impression"" of a reporter or a critic who has not been affected at all.I think it's only natural to give priority to what Sushiro, the actual victim of the disaster, thinks.",1,1
"If the Peropero boys' claim is accepted, it will be applied to those who have committed similar vicious acts in the past.If they are told that they didn't need to replace all the equipment, or that the decline in sales was due to competition, they will have no choice but to cry themselves to sleep, and the same kind of malicious acts will be committed more frequently in the future.No matter how much they want to escape compensation, this claim by the perpetrator is a mess, and I can't believe that they are sorry for what they have done.",1,1
"If this had happened a long time ago when there were no social networking services, or if the staff had found out about this behavior, it would have been a simple exchange between the boy and the store. But if the story spread and was reported in the press, the store would have no choice but to act.",1,1
"It is often mentioned that the victim was socially sanctioned, but this is irrelevant in terms of damages, not to mention the amount of punishment.The victim did not spread the video, and it was a third party, completely unrelated to the victim, who slandered the victim by doing so.The perpetrator may compensate the slanderer for the damages, but he cannot ask the victim to write it off.",1,1
"Before the issue, the defense of the issue,""the opinion of the defendant"" oror ""the opinion of the lawyer""?is important.If you get a lawyer who says, ""My job is to lighten my client's sentence, so I don't care what people think of my client afterwards.If you get a lawyer who says, ""My job is to lighten my client's sentence, so I don't care what people think of my client afterwards,"" there is a high possibility that he will make a terrible mistake.If the person's defense is""I'm sorry that what I did lightly turned out to be unexpectedly important and caused a lot of trouble for the restaurant.If only it hadn't been spread, we wouldn't have had to do this. It was just a student prank, so don't say ""reimbursement"" and let it slide.The way the public perceives the situation changes depending on whether it is a ""student prank"" or not.But whichever the original is, there is a danger that it could mean the same thing, depending on how the third-party lawyer phrases it.",1,1
"After the attorney's defense, I re-calculated it based on the points raised in the opinion and realized a serious miscalculation. This is a case where they could have said that the bill is 67 billion yen. In fact, I think it's a substantial loss as well. I think it would be good if they were as flashy as the U.S. in this kind of case, even if it means putting the spotlight on copycats.",1,1
"There are probably other perpetrators, so all the bottles were washed, and various measures were taken to prevent future perpetrators, so it would be impossible to blame the boy for all of this. There are countless other perpetrators who have not yet become apparent.I'm not defending the perpetrators, but I think it's rather unjust to hound the perpetrators by charging them extremely unjust amounts of money when they have already received enough social sanctions.I wonder if they have any remorse for their own lack of hygiene. It is typical of Sushiro to cheat from time to time.",1,1
"Why did you replace all the bottles? It is natural to replace all bottles. If you replace the word ""wash"" with ""wash"", there is no reason to say, ""We washed only the dirty mouth part. There is no reason to say, ""We washed the entire bottle. It is the same as ""I washed the entire unit. It's that kind of thinking that allows people to commit such nuisances with impunity, don't you think?",1,1
"I'm really disappointed that Sushiro would charge the boy this much.""There is no way that the real damage and impact would be a measly 60 million yen.Can this amount be paid? This is the part where we have to beThe amount of money was arrived at by considering the realistic and realistic amount to be charged.",1,1
"I'm not saying the juvenile is saying it, but the juvenile's side (the juvenile's lawyer?) is saying it. I guess the boy's side (lawyer?) is saying it, but I don't think you should be the one to say it.I would like to see if they will settle the case or if they will be sentenced with a reduced amount.I can see some people defending the boy, saying that ""the world is too cold,"" but I seriously want to know what elements are there to defend the boy.",1,1
"It just happened to be a Sushiro restaurant, but similar incidents could occur in the food and beverage industry, and the increase in expenses for countermeasures, etc., and the reduction in property value alone due to the damage to the image of the restaurant would be a significant amount of money.",1,1
"You just don't understand that the world is built on the premise of trust, from friendship in the smallest to money in the largest.It's not about whether it's funny that you changed all the soy sauce containers, or that your sales dropped because of competition from a competing restaurant.Quitting school is only a personal responsibility, social responsibility is another matter.",1,1
"I think there are still plenty of cases like that that haven't been publicized, so I think I'll at least try to take them home.Also, considering the fact that bite terrorism has been spreading for a long time, it should be expected that someone will spread the word.And understand that bad things don't care about gender or age,You can be sorry after you've paid for the damage.Right now, it's just a pose of remorse.If it's 100 million or so, you can pay it back over the rest of your life.I don't think I'd rather have to go to court and pay legal fees than to set up a payment schedule so I don't have to pay more money.",1,1
"No matter how many lawyers defend the perpetrator boy and his family, the bottom line is that it would have been better if the boy had not acted like that. The boy is expelled from school, withdrawn, and remorseful. But it's a ""post-festival"" even if he says he's sorry. In this case, the crime of a major breakdown in the reliability of the food that goes into the mouth is a serious one. Suppose the boy and his family could eat with impunity the food that was put in other people's mouths? It would be impossible.",1,1
"I think Sushiro should stick to its stance. I think that the idea that just apologizing for being a minor is enough to be forgiven should be eradicated. Even if they are junior high school or elementary school students, they should be made to take responsibility for serious accidents or disruptive behavior.",1,1
"Even though he is a boy, he is old enough to understand how to tell things apart.He should have been able to foresee the consequences of his actions.He acted in a provocative manner, not only toward Sushiro, but toward the world,I deserved it. Please spend a lifetime earning and paying to make amends to the people you have caused trouble for. You are not sorry when you are arguing back through your lawyer in the first place.",1,1
"Socially sanctioned? Perhaps he was socially sanctioned, but that was his own fault, which is completely different from the damage Sushiro has suffered.The fact that he claims to be sorry, but then refutes it by saying, ""Why did you replace all the bottles? It is easy to guess that he is not sorry.",1,1
"The world is made up of good intentions (manners, etc.) as well as laws, and that is why consumers' behavior is influenced by such good intentions. In this case, the consumers avoided the product because it was far from their good intentions. Consumer behavior should be subjective, but since you are influencing it, I don't think you can say that you are not responsible.If there was no intention to spread the news, then it would be the fault of those who let it spread, but then the media would be the bad guys. For example, the media spreads reports of infidelity all over the place, and even stories that would otherwise calm down become unsettled. If the media is held liable because they did not intend to spread the news, does that mean we can sue the media and win?I don't want the boy's side to be crushed by a thorough fight at all, but, well, the claim seems like a bitter excuse.",1,1
"It seems that you are still unable to reflect on your actions.Please make sure to give a detailed damage amount and press for compensation, including the parents.If you allow it to happen here, the same thing will happen later.You should show here that if you cause trouble to other people or companies, there is a commensurate risk.Tougher measures.",1,1
"I believe that the full 67 million in damages or even double-digit million is possible, depending on the outcome of the legal hearing, but the article＞On the other hand, the media is still conspicuous in its defense of the assailant even at this stage.On the other hand, I do not agree with the conclusion thatMost of the headlines I read are defending Sushiro.I agree with the voices of support for Sushiro, considering the perpetrator boy's criminal intent to lick others and the manager's gall, but this assumption in the article is not good, and it reminded me again that ""Minkabu Magazine"" is not to be trusted.No matter how much the conclusion is the same, this kind of approach makes us think that the motive for writing the article is not for social justice or the rehabilitation of the juvenile (the idea that high compensation is necessary for the rehabilitation of the juvenile is also valid), but simply to protect shareholder interests.In the first place, it is absurd for ""Minkabu Magazine,"" which regularly carries Heizo Takeshita's excusive and supercilious writings, to publish such an article.",1,1
"Civil"" is only compensation for damage and has nothing to do with punishment or rehabilitation.If the problem is the spread of the video, the juvenile can sue the video spreader in a civil case.Sushiro and the video diffuser have basically nothing to do with each other.Social sanctions are also irrelevant here, as they are a circumstantial requirement for ""criminal"" punishment.",1,1
"Frankly, I feel sorry for Sushiro.They are doing this in the midst of high prices and a growing loss of customers.They are the complete victims and deserve to be compensated.We need to change the trend that anything a juvenile does will be forgiven.Publicizing the serious crime here will serve as a deterrent.",1,1
"If the school's decision to expel the student was voluntary, there is no fault on Sushiro's part.Sushiro didn't tell him to drop out of school, did he?If the school says there is no need to drop out, then the student can just go to school every day.If the school expelled him, it was in accordance with the school rules.If you have something to say about it, you can appeal to the school to cancel the expulsion.If you feel that your peaceful life is threatened, you can sue the perpetrator if he/she did something directly to you.If you are worried about what others think of you, then there is no one to blame but yourself.You just made the decision on your own.In the end, I think it's just an excuse.",1,1
"I think there is a difference between social and legal sanctions.If you are a high school student, you are old enough to know what is right and wrong to do.You should know that what could be a prank for a small child will not be tolerated once he or she is somewhat mature.",1,1
"However, since it has become common for local courts to make strange rulings, the case should be taken to the high court or the Supreme Court.",1,1
"When I say juvenile side's rebuttal, I mean it's a lawyer's job.It's a trial.Lawyers are just doing what they can, as a job.It may not be what the juvenile really wants, or what the parents really want, or even the lawyer really wants.You don't even think that all of these objections will be taken into account.It's the work of the lawyer in court who is saying that he thinks it's enough to have it taken into account.As for the amount of the bill, the juvenile's lawyer is probably thinking...this is about right...I guess.",1,1
"If you want to claim that it's the spreader's fault for the expensive damages.If you want to claim that it is the fault of the person who spread the news, why don't you pay the damages first and then identify the other party and sue them in a separate civil case?I'm looking forward to seeing what the court decides.",1,1
"The company you are dealing with is a stock company, and it is not an individual store, but a chain of stores that sell a brand.Also, the image damage caused by the spread of social networking sites is horrible, and some companies have advisors or dedicated people to operate them.I think the companies are crying themselves to sleep rather a lot for the amount of damages.",1,1
"As Attorney Kitamura said on You Tube, Sushiro is only suing this boy.If they really want to get compensation, they need to sue the guardians as well.Sushiro is suing the boy not for damages, but to deter copycats.",1,1
"Spreading the word on social media is all that matters.If the manager had just found out, he would have been banned and that would have been the end of it.However, the fact that it has spread throughout the country and the world makes it almost irreversible.It doesn't matter how many millions of yen it costs.Be aware of the fear of social networking.Both the government and the media should take this seriously.Public relations should also be thorough.This is the responsibility of the agencies, who left the SNS unattended.The check function and compliance should be thorough.This should be a stone for others to learn from.",1,1
"In this world, I don't agree that the guilty party wins.First of all, we need to be sorry, and it is the decision of the person who has been wronged whether to forgive or not.It is hard to understand that because you made a mistake, you think you can be forgiven.Well, thanks to you, I can get into Sushiro without standing in line these days...But for the store, it must be terrible.",1,1
"I am aware that Sushiro takes such harsh measures against others.If you're tough on others, you have to be tough on yourself too.I hope you haven't forgotten that you've piled on the scandals yourself, which means there won't be a next time. You have to remember that.",1,1
"This is a scenario in which the defense is trying to thoroughly argue the case from the point where it can be broken down, isn't it?Sushiro's side should probably have a thorough fight with the defense, including the calculation method used to come up with that amount of money.It is no longer enough to settle the case on emotion alone.",1,1
"You didn't have to mention competitors.""Essentially, the countermeasure is not a countermeasure, all stores are unreasonable, and only the stores in question should be compensated or responded to.""The spread was an attempt to cause damage led by influencers.""The damage is temporary and sales have recovered in a short period of time.",1,1
"Basically, the problem is that people do not know what they are allowed to do and what they are not allowed to do. I think it is not good for people to do what they want with public things in public places, which can be selfish and cause trouble to others. What would have been obvious in the old days, when parents would discipline their children and those around them would warn them, has now become a misguided assertion of oneself to gain popularity on social networking sites. This is not cool, and from a normal person's point of view, it is offensive. In light of this, the phrase ""the decline in sales is a competitive factor"" seems to me to be a ""backhanded"" statement by the perpetrator to the public. If you ask me, ""Screw you!"" I think it is. By the way, personally, I don't want to go to kaiten-zushi anymore.""",1,1
"It may be true that the decline in sales is due to competition, but there is always competition to begin with, and the responsibility for creating an opening for competitors to take advantage of lies on the boy's side. To say that he is not responsible for this is like saying that if you push a person into the water and drown him, it is not murder because he died because he was drowned and not because he was strangled to death by the water. This kind of defense is not very attractive. I think the ""it's just a boy"" argument is going to back down considerably.",1,1
"I didn't anticipate the proliferation.""It's a selfish way of thinking, as if you don't need to be found out.If you don't do something annoying in the first place...If you don't take videos in the first place.Don't upload the video to social media in the first place.It's all something you (or someone close to you) did.If you take into account the possibility that they were doing these acts behind your back, replacing all the bottles is also normal.It is not the perpetrator who should be protected, but the customers who come to the store and use it normally.",1,1
"Why didn't Sushiro file a lawsuit jointly with Kura Sushi, Hama Sushi, and others against the conveyor-belt sushi chain for causing trouble? It is doubtful that they are not pursuing the guilt of the photographers, who are considered equally culpable, including the people who were filming as well as the peroparo boys. I feel sorry for the boys, but I hope it proves to be a huge compensation to prevent the next incident from happening.",1,1
"Socially sanctioned? Are you trying to tell me that because I dropped out of school, I'm not at fault or obligated to pay? That is not acceptable for a member of society. Is it permissible because I am a student? Must I be forgiven? Don't be ridiculous! I want to say. How much trouble have I caused to the world, and how much have I made people hesitate to eat out? The victim is in a position to say that his/her peace has been disturbed, and the perpetrator is in no way in a position to do so. If you want to live peacefully, you should seriously follow rules and morals and not cause trouble for others. What is the point of putting what you have done on the shelf and saying that your peace has been disturbed? I can only feel anger at such a response.",1,1
"The defense theory seems to be that the replacement of bottles in all stores was an excessive response on Sushiro's part, and that the amount of compensation should be reduced to that of the affected stores only. Well, I don't think they will win.",1,1
"Apparently, he has no remorse, and I hope Sushiro takes the seriousness of the matter seriously and does it thoroughly so that he can sincerely reflect and regret what he did....Actually, I had some sympathy for the boy's mischief, saying that it was harsh even though it was unavoidable, but that feeling was blown away when I saw the rebuttal.I sincerely hope that this will cause those idiots who still enjoy annoying videos to reconsider.",1,1
"Have you already been socially sanctioned...? If you are still making such a big deal out of this, and if you are still saying ""Shut up, I'm sorry"", then the sanction was not a factor that prompted you to reflect on your actions,I think it is out of line to ask for a reduction in the amount because of the sanction.I think that the amount of money is quite lenient, even though Sushiro's reputation has been damaged to the point where a bill in the order of a billion dollars would not be out of line, considering the size of the company.",1,1
"The lawyer seems to have answered, ""We did not expect it to spread,"" but there have been many reports of byte terror, oden tsuntsun, and other similar nuisances for quite some time.It is often said that 'kids today don't watch TV,' but did the boy really have no chance to learn the news...?It may be true that it was a 'child's act,' but it would not go over well with a high school student who 'didn't think it was a bad thing.Based on that, I think that the 67 million yen charge on the Sushiro side is quite warmly received.It is a minimum rule of society not to cause trouble for others.Those who feel sorry for the boy should first warn the children around him.",1,1
"The fact that you make comments like this is because you still think that ""this is the least you can do"", isn't it?Where do you see any sign of remorse?For example, if a defect is found in one of the food products on the market, it is normal to dispose of the entire lot, so it is appropriate to replace the product in all stores to dispel the concerns of customers.",1,1
"If Sushiro wants to sue the boy for the decrease in stock price, of course he is at fault, but if Sushiro wants to sue for the decrease in stock price, the influencer and the poster of the video who spread it in a funny way should also be punished accordingly.Without the posting of the video and the influencer's spreading of the video, it would not have come to the public's attention and would not have led to a decrease in the stock price, so unless the appropriate punishment is given, I believe that these annoying influencers will continue to spread their annoying behavior for their own need for approval.",1,1
"> ""Why did they replace all the bottles?""⇒ I think the juvenile side needs to prove that the other bottles were not perused.＞The decrease in sales could be due to a competitive factor.⇒ If it was a competitive factor, I think sales would decrease on a yearly basis. I think Sushiro should show sales trends on a monthly basis. (I assume sales dropped right after the Sushipero issue and are slowly recovering?)",1,1
"You could be doing the same thing on another day in another seat. I have to realize that I'm in a situation where I have to go that far.I still ask for a new bottle. To be honest, sometimes the new bottle doesn't come, and I don't even know if I'm wiping the stinger, but it's a matter of feeling.",1,1
"When you shoot a video and post it on a social networking service that can be viewed by an unspecified number of people, you can fully assume that it will be disseminated.The expulsion from high school and the disruption of his peaceful life were all the result of his own actions, and to say that he was socially sanctioned because of it is a selfish argument to no end.Sushiro would probably want to kick him to the curb and say, ""I don't know.Do we have to throw away all the soy sauce bottles? As long as the subject can't be identified, it's a natural course of action.It's customary to request dismissal in cases like this, and even though it's the lawyer's job to force a reason for the defense, couldn't you have come up with a better argument?",1,1
"Defenders = media. The reason is because they do the same thing on information shows and variety shows.Replacing all bottles. The reason is that the boy himself showed that one of them may not be the target. There is a possibility that they are doing it elsewhere, and the obligation to eliminate all of them arose. In the same case, foreign substances in food products are all recalled and then disposed of.",1,1
"For example, if a box is crushed, even if the contents are decent, it is not a product...then the person who crushed it should buy it back...that much should be acceptable, but if the stock that is not crushed is not sold because everyone thinks it is damaged, it is too much.　However, even if the inventory is not crushed, everyone thinks it is damaged and it could not be sold, so it would be too much to ask ・・・・ to buy it back.　In this case, replacing everything is wrong in itself. If all the stores had flipped the soy sauce by Ore......................................So the damage ・・・・ that caused that damage was done by inflammatory people who made a fuss about objectively hygienic food, saying, ""Here, look, this sushi place is inedible. It is the unreasonable society that forces us to throw away everything when we can't eat it psychologically.　Recently, we made the decision to show movies even when there was a marijuana case, and to air TV even when there was an affair. Perhaps the day has come to decriminalize extreme cancellation culture.",1,1
"In the first place, there are people who say A and people who say B about one thing.Some people see a flower and say it is beautiful, while others say they don't like it.Therefore, I think it is natural that there are opinions that defend both the perpetrator and the victim.",1,1
"For example, many people have a cold opinion about unmanned dumpling stores, saying that they are doing it because they don't want to spend money on hiring people, so they should be prepared to take that kind of risk. Shouldn't they also be prepared to take the risk of having this kind of thing done to them?",1,1
I think it is people who think like this who cause problems.,1,1
"What I don't like is that the people on the perpetrator's side, who have contributed to the spread of the video on social networking sites and in the press, and who have contributed to the spread of Sushiro's damage, are now slamming the boy as if he were the victim.They are unaware of their own culpability in the video, and it is disgusting to see that they are talking as if the ""current times"" and the ""Internet"" automatically spread the video, even though they voluntarily clicked the retweet button and made the national news.The judiciary should decide the extent to which the juvenile should be compensated, and I am not going to complain about the outcome. Right now, I just don't like the attitude of the outside world.",1,1
"I don't have a problem with how much you charge, but I would like to see you issue a ruling after careful scrutiny of which ones are actual damages.The United States and China, which have introduced punitive damages, do not issue such judgments to individuals. Even if they did, they would not pay.",1,1
"Basically, third parties other than the victim are not in a position to say that the punishment should be reduced out of sympathy for the perpetrator, or rather, only the victim himself who has actually suffered a disadvantage should be in a position to say that, right? How can an outsider sympathize with them and tell them to reduce the amount? So you guys are going to shoulder the reduced amount? Who's going to pay for the reduced amount? The victims? You can make selfish statements because you are irrelevant and don't think about your responsibilities. I wish you would be a little more responsible and mature in your statements. Advocate.",1,1
"Here's the thing, boy, do you understand?What you did may have been a joke at just one store. But the fact that it was spread around, and that it made your customers distrust what you did, saying that maybe someone else did it too, and it just wasn't exposed because it hadn't surfaced.That you quit school, and that the impact was so great that it could not be contained to that extent.Sushiro temporarily suffered a ¥16 billion drop in stock price. I think the sin of having caused the public to distrust food to that extent is very great.We have to understand that. There are things you can do and things you can't do.It's the same with people who take pictures, but I think we need to be able to understand the thoughts of various people, not just our own.",1,1
"Some people may say that ""the amount charged by Kurazushi is too high,"" but it is better to understand that it is a compassionate measure that should make people crawl to the ground and be thankful, considering the actual damage.This is just my personal opinion, but I think it is just as well to make the perpetrators of theft, extortion, etc. pay double the total amount of damages, and if they cannot pay, they should be forced to work until they can pay. (Well, I am not concerned with my own damage, which is probably already past the statute of limitations.)P.S.By the way, I heard that this assailant dropped out of high school, but his attitude this time will make his neighbors so disgusted with him that he will not be able to live in his current house anymore. I guess it's all the best for the neighborhood, but I wonder if the newcomers can refuse to accept him...?",1,1
"Why did you replace all the bottles?' It must be the fault of the assailant boy.I stopped going to Sushiro after this incident, and I have only had take-out from Kura Sushi once.I used to eat at Kaiten Sushi at least twice a month, but after seeing the video of this incident on the news, I have lost interest in going there.It was singer Haruo Sanba who said, ""The customer is God."" Sanba also said, ""Customers who buy my records and come to my concerts are God.No matter what kind of customer, they are not God. I hope Sushiro will win the case satisfactorily, and if the perpetrator is punished properly, I will go to Sushiro again with peace of mind.",1,1
"Sushiro does not need to take a step back.Those who comment in defense of the perpetrators are not responsible for their words in any way. Of course, they are not the people who run the restaurant industry, and they should refrain from making irresponsible comments.The general opinion is which one is right.",1,1
"People who don't know the difference between right and wrong need to be told, ""If you do something wrong, I'll charge you a lot of money! If they do something wrong, I'll charge them a lot of money!There is no deterrent for latecomers who think such trivial things are funny, such as the fact that the person is sorry or that he/she has been socially sanctioned.But, you know, even elementary school children don't lick hot water bottles or soy sauce bottles, do they?Discipline is really important.",1,1
"Why did you replace it? Whether it stands as a counterargument or not.I think it was to prevent a decrease in sales and a drop in stock price.Just like when Mr. W. Dept. had people disgusted by the mere mention of ""T-purpose toilets"",When visitors see the bottle, they associate it with Perot. No matter which store, no matter which seat.I think it's meant to dispel that, and considering the loss in sales if we hadn't done it.67 or 93 million might not be enough.We don't have to accept everything Sushiro says, but a careless rebuttal could lose even the best defense of the perpetrator.",1,1
"The juvenile's lawyer said,""As for the impact on sales, the juvenile's lawyer said that some of the decline was due to ""competition"" and that the hygiene rumor problem was ""extremely subjective psychology on the part of consumers,"" denying any connection to the juvenile's conduct and asking that the claim be dismissed.""No matter how you look at it, it is no surprise that customers would leave if such images were shown,Denying that the boy's actions had anything to do with it is not something that the ""remorseful"" side can say.The ""remorseful"" side also states in its reply brief that the juvenile was forced to ""drop out of high school"" and suffered ""disruption of his peaceful life,"" as stated in the opening paragraph.""This is all due to the fact that it was spread on social media, and there is nothing wrong with the Sushiro side, right?Is this asking for extenuating circumstances on Sushiro's side?But what I did, the proliferation, was self-inflicted.That's not a reason for extenuating circumstances, is it?Well, I guess lawyers who want to make a name for themselves will defend such a trivial trial.",1,1
"I don't know why I have to go into the part of management that doesn't know anything about the guy who did this stupid thing in the groove, or if it's not the word of a lawyer, it's just a disgrace.It's no exaggeration to say that a company's image is vital.Daily cleaning may be sanitary, but when something like this happens, the public is going to take a hard look at how you respond to it.And since Sushiro is not the only sushi restaurant, it is easy for customers to leave.Other restaurants should be aware that this is not limited to a single restaurant, and that it is a big social issue.It is only natural to protect the company that has built up to this point and the families who work there, rather than the boy and his family.Please ask the judge for extenuating circumstances.",1,1
"I went to eat at Sushiro right after the incident and the fish was good. It was so good that I went back a week later and the quality of the fish was so-so. A month later, I went back and the fish was very bad and tasteless. It was back to the same bad Sushiro of before the incident. I swore I would never go there again.",1,1
"I shouldn't have done the stupid thing I thought would be popular.That is all I have to say.It was the juvenile's side that made the entrance to the incident, such as being sued for damages. I don't think he is old enough to judge what will happen if he does it, so I think it is okay to give him an additional sanction if he makes a strange objection.",1,1
"Of course it's definitely that guy's fault that sales went down.You have to demonstrate that rationally, and if you say you haven't taken precautionary measuresThat seems reasonable too. I don't think the trial will be driven by emotion alone, and the amount of the claim.I don't think the damages will be ordered as it is because that's max, but if it's a jury trial, I don't think it's a good idea.I don't think the amount of damages will be ordered as it is, but if it is a jury trial, I feel there is a possibility that it could be a large amount of money.I think this kind of thing is for show, but in the end, it is a case of people and children who lack rational judgment, so I think it will happen again.I think it will happen again. When they forget about it.",1,1
"If they didn't replace the bottles, customers wouldn't be able to eat with peace of mind because of the fear that copycats might have come out and done it.",1,1
"I haven't been to Kaiten Sushi since this incident. I don't know what these people are doing in and out of the restaurant. Business is built on trust, and if I feel suspicious, I don't go there. This incident created the opportunity for that. In a way, I am glad that it was publicized. I've learned to refrain from eating out.",1,1
"The decline in sales coincides with the period when they did a lot of things.Tuna forgery, false announcements, and so on.I think it's good to compensate him for the large amount of damages, but it's also good to have him forget about the many other things that went wrong at Koko.",1,1
"If the crime is not so serious, this person may escalate his/her behavior in the future. To prevent this from happening, we must make sure that the punishment is commensurate with the crime committed this time.",1,1
"It is not about whether social sanctions are appropriate,It is damages, so the amount of compensation for damages would be appropriate.However, I am sorry to say that both Sushiro and Kappa have terrible products. I haven't been there in a long time, but who would pay for that quality?It's not a question of expensive or cheap,The quality of sushi is better at the same price at the small-scale conveyor-belt sushi restaurants. The business does not take advantage of the scale at all. That is the big problem.The quality of management is too low.",1,1
"I don't see any remorse for what he did. In the video, it may have been in one store and in that seat, but if we think that the assailant may have done it in a different store or in a different seat, I think it is necessary to replace them all.I also think that the person who filmed and posted the video should be punished appropriately, in addition to the juvenile perpetrator.",1,1
"For example, if you show the sales before and after the video, you can immediately explain how much sales were affected.",1,1
"You can't just talk about only those licked bottles or only at those restaurants, can you?Perojirou's licking has given the whole country a preconceived notion that Sushiro's conveyor-belt sushi soy sauce bottles were licked and are dirty.Even if it's not at that particular restaurant. The fact that sales are actually declining is proof of this.So Sushiro needed to show consumers that all its stores are clean.They don't understand how important image is to a company, especially in the food and beverage industry, and how difficult it is to attract customers back once they have left.I think it was the minimum necessary action to regain the lost trust.",1,1
"In the old days, sushi conveyor-belt sushi restaurants had a chef in the lane making the sushi.The lanes were not so large that only two or three craftsmen could turn the sushi.Because of the close watchfulness of the craftsmen, I don't think there was anyone who misbehaved.In fact, I have never heard of any problematic behavior at a conveyor-belt sushi restaurant where the sushi chefs were making sushi in the lanes.",1,1
"From Sushiro's side, they don't care about 60 million in compensation.If they do this kind of nuisance, the company will sue them and take them to court.There will be a warning that it will be difficult to return to a peaceful life.Even if the trial drags on, Sushiro's side will probably hope for it.",1,1
"There is no ""intent to share"" and ""no expectation of dissemination,"" but then who put it up on social networking sites and networks? The person who filmed it? If so, that person should be considered an accomplice.Personally, I think the compensation should be in the hundreds of millions, because if they only get away with a million dollars for this, they will be surprised that they only get away with a million dollars for doing something this bad.",1,1
"The perpetrator boy and those who defend him are mistaken.The problem is not that the video was spread, but that the Sushi Pero boy is fundamentally guilty of doing something he should not have done.If it had not gone viral, it would not be a problem if he was just having fun among his friends, but he should be sorry for having done something he should not have done.",1,1
"The perpetrator does not have to defend himself. The boy's side should pay the difference in lost sales based on the lost sales before and after the Sushipero incident. If the punishment is not that severe, such cases will recur. Everything should be considered as part of education.Pampering is not good for him.",1,1
"Who is the one who has committed an unforgivable misbehavior at a restaurant that serves inexpensive and delicious sushi, thereby damaging the image of not only the restaurant but the industry as a whole?The ""expulsion from high school"" and ""disruption of a peaceful life"" that the boy claims are merely punishments inflicted by society for his actions.If he had not posted the information on social networking sites, he would not have received such punishment.What are you talking about when you posted them on social networking sites?The social sanction is completely different from compensation for damages on Sushiro's side.Sushiro is claiming purely for damages.It does not include the sanctions against the boy, nor does Sushiro have the right to sanction the boy.The amount of compensation claimed is so high that it appears as if a sanction is being given.I haven't seen the breakdown of the claim, but I think a reasonable amount of money would be approved in court if it wasn't added to the claim in a strange way.And while social sanctions are taken into account in the criminal penalty, they have nothing to do with the claim for damages.",1,1
"It may have been a slight, but the damages are as good as done.Lawyers are obligated to defend their clients, but that's no excuse.I think it's a good idea to make an example of him so that it won't happen in the future.You are still young. You can always start over.",1,1
"Regarding the hygiene rumor problem, he denies any relationship with the boy's actions, saying, ""It's an extremely subjective psychology of consumers.→The boy is the one who triggered that consumer psychology, right? The obvious main culprit, right?The boy's side also denies the destruction and replacement of equipment and supplies, ""We demand an explanation as to why all the soy sauce bottles were destroyed and replaced.→ Can't you imagine how many consumers will respond, ""Someone must have licked this bottle too..."" or ""I don't want to use this bottle even if it's been washed...""? The trigger for that consumer psychology (see below).It's hard work, even for a lawyer.No one in general needs to be nurtured.",1,1
"The fact is that the people who are complaining about people or companies that have nothing to do with them are the ones who are causing the flames.However, at least since the incident, I have no intention of using Sushiro at all.I may be invited to go there in the future, but I don't think I will ever go to Sushiro by myself like before.That's the reality.I have nothing but doubts about the food security that Sushiro has maintained, regardless of whether they replace the soy sauce or stop turning.It may only be a few hundred thousand dollars over the course of a lifetime, but sales have definitely dropped as a result of the incident.Even if the news doesn't spread, I won't go there at first when I see the news.",1,1
"You say the stock price has dropped, but the stock price is up absurdly now because he took a firm stand on that incident. If you are going to charge him 67 million because the stock price dropped because of the incident, give him back the increase in the current stock price and the increase in his social credibility.",1,1
"Regardless of what the boy's side may argue, without this incident, the stock price would not have fallen and Sushiro would not have had to spend money to replace the soy sauce jugs and remodel the restaurant. This is a fact.The boy's side argues that this is too much, but it is an effort to regain the trust that the company has once lost. Since the boy is the one who destroyed that trust, he deserves a penalty.He should pay for the rest of his life.",1,1
"How can we defend the fact that he even made a video of himself doing such a vulgar thing in the first place?It was in the middle of the Corona disaster, so replacing all the soy sauce bottles was a normal thing to do. The reason why the stock price dropped so quickly was that the spread of the video of the boy had damaged the corporate brand.",1,1
">""Expulsion from high school"" and ""disruption of peaceful life"".Huh?"" I think.It was the perpetrator boy who interfered with the ""peaceful life"" of many people who go to eat at Kaiten Sushi, wasn't it?>""Why did you replace all the bottles?""I also think, ""What?"" I think.This is a boy who does such insane things. Besides the video in question, he may be doing the same thing at other tables and lanes.It is natural that the juvenile should have a lawyer on his side, which is good, but if the lawyer really cares about the juvenile offender and has the juvenile's best interest at heart, he should let the juvenile know the seriousness of his crime and properly rehabilitate him, instead of making excuses like a frying boy. I don't think that simply making the crime less serious will benefit the juvenile from the bottom up.",1,1
"You quit for your own reasons because you found it difficult to stay at the school.The whole replacement of soy sauce bottles was also to dispel the users' anxiety, and since it is the perpetrator's actions that are causing the users' anxiety, it is only natural that he should be held responsible for that.The perpetrator's argument is so absurd.",1,1
"Most of the netizens appear to be supportive of Sushiro.Some media, critics, and commentators are defending the boy for some reason, but are these people affirming the statements that the boy's lawyer brought up, from ""he is sorry"" or ""there was no intention to spread"" or ""expulsion from high school"" or ""disruption of his peaceful life,"" as if shifting the responsibility to Sushiro I wonder if they are.There is a concept of ""negligence"" in civil law, but basic ""extenuating circumstances"" does not fit in.",1,1
"I think you're kind of reopening the door. You're not taking it seriously. How old are you, boy? He knows what he is allowed to do and what he is not allowed to do. Also, the reason the amount of damages went up is because they thought you were opening up. If he had accepted the situation sincerely and taken a serious attitude toward paying back, there might be a sense of gratitude. Anyway, I think it would be good if the whole family came together and apologized = paid up.",1,1
"If we settle out of court or give them a small fine or lenient forgiveness, these people are easy to deal with! And they will lick the public's lips and do it again. The lawyers are just trying to come up with reasons to say that they are sorry and have received social sanctions. That's because it's their job. In general, despite all the media coverage, this kind of behavior has not decreased at all. To deter such behavior in the future, companies should be willing to pay higher and higher compensation. It's hard for private companies to keep going to court.",1,1
"＞The question, ""We demand an explanation as to why all soy sauce bottles were disposed of and replaced,"" is posed to the plaintiff, Sushiro.As Sushiro, we want all our customers to feel as safe as possible when they visit our restaurants.In the first place, if the boy had not done this, he would not have done such a costly thing,There have been many videos of problematic behavior outside of Sushiro, and there has been a lot of fuss about it, but can you and your family members and lawyers eat at the same affiliated restaurants without any distrust?> Furthermore, the boy's side stated in his defense that he was forced to ""drop out of high school"" and suffered ""disruption of his peaceful life,"" as stated at the beginning of this article.This has nothing to do with Sushiro.(It is a different story if he was exposed, expelled from school voluntarily, unable to walk the streets, etc.)You don't have to tell Sushiro, you can sue the person who sent out your personal information on social networking sites.",1,1
"I agree, these kids are not looking for approval by posting their photos on the Internet, they are just doing it out of a micro need for approval from their friends in front of them.I am sure that even on social networking sites, they are only connected to their real friends. But they don't have enough imagination to realize that the whole world can see it, that it can make people uncomfortable, and that they can be arrested or sued if they are not very good at it. I hope this case will be a little deterrent.",1,1
"I would direct you to hold Sushiro legally accountable.Before you defend them, you are forgetting what the so called juvenile did to cause this to happen.And if they didn't, it wouldn't have been an issue.The idea that it was something that was allowed to spread (if it wasn't found out) that it was something that was overlooked (defense attorney) makes the situation worse.",1,1
"If you had locked your booth and it spread, that's one thing, but if you made it available for anyone to see, you wanted everyone to see it.If the number of customers and sales had suddenly decreased after the incident without any other major reason, this would be the cause.The other objections sound like bitter excuses and whining to me, but I'm wondering if they are excuses to reduce the amount of money or if they are serious.",1,1
"I'm wondering what kind of mindset the lawyer had in taking the job. The conduct is clear, and I'd think they'd rather be in a position to admit the conduct in full and ask for a reduction in damages. Dropping the claim is like saying, in essence, ""pretend it never happened."" The decision should not be influenced by public opinion or public sentiment, but even taking into account the fact that he has already received social sanctions such as expulsion from school, I don't think the court's opinion will be favorable.",1,1
"The objective may be to reduce the amount of compensation, but the tactic of fabricating the victim's fault to offset it is unwise and unpleasant to listen to. I would like you to rethink the practice of benefiting those who argue in court. This time it was a company, but if I were to be subjected to this kind of treatment as an individual, the victim would be doubly and thrice treated in an unpleasant and unreasonable manner.",1,1
"There are no extenuating circumstances for the boy. Because you haven't even apologized. No wonder he refuses to apologize, if he still goes by the front of the store and gets down on his knees for days. If in front of the store is obstructing business, why not in front of the nearby train station? They'll mosaic your face anyway, and if you're on YouTube, your face is already there. Only after you go that far will you get an apology. Sushiro employees would have lost part-time hours, and full-time employees would have lost their bonuses. Many have families. Were those people guilty?",1,1
"The defendant's answer will be written by the defense, and now, I'm going to put it out, okay? All right? He said.I'll leave it to you.I can imagine that there was an exchange of ""I'll leave it to you.I hope you have a thorough fight with a naive lawyer.Subjectivity of the customer?Well, then, if there is an objective way to prove that no one licked the bottle in front of you, I'd like to see this defense attorney prove it.How would this defense attorney explain if he claims that there is no impact with the competition?",1,1
It is inevitable that these behaviors will become more severe because they have not been eliminated because they have not been severe before.It just happened to be your child at the start.I don't feel sorry for the perpetrators because this could have been prevented if they had been educated about Internet literacy at home and about disruptive behavior in stores.,1,1
"If it were a mere one store problem, it would probably be a small compensation, but the impact on a national-level chain of stores is significant.The influencers may have been the ones who spread the word, but it is clear that the very act of posting on social networking sites is based on the premise of spreading the word, and has even become an objective. I feel that this is ""shallow"" and ""an ugly way to get away with it.""",1,1
"I doubt if he is remorseful when he says this.Even if Sushiro had won the full amount in court, they could have set a precedent for the future, and if they had shown proper remorse, they might have been forgiven.If the timing is right, I think it will improve the company's image.However, it may have been the wisdom of the lawyers, but wouldn't they be less inclined to forgive if they were told something like this?How strong a campaign did your competitor run at that time?Replacing all the soy sauce jugs was also necessary to remove the fear that maybe they were being licked.What about the stock price plunge after the news?It's obvious at a nano-glance that this is the reason for all of this.You should think carefully about the meaning of reflection.",1,1
"Frankly, I have no sympathy for them, no matter how large the amount.How much effort does it take to provide good food at an unbeatable price for an inherently expensive food such as sushi? Moreover, by creating a safe and hygienic environment, Sushiro has gained the trust of its customers and risen to the top of the industry.The crime of undermining that trust is serious, and the fact that the perpetrator has to suffer for it is, in a sense, his own fault.How many adults have had to work hard to restore trust in the company, even if it was only lightly? An apology or a little atonement is not enough to make up for it.As in the case of the ""One Punishment, One Hundred Commandments"" law, if we show a lenient face here, the same kind of behavior will increase one after another.Is it necessary to replace all the bottles in the first place? This is an opinion that disrespects the safety and security of food, and is evidence of a lack of understanding of the world-class food safety and security that Japan prides itself on.Those who are making a nuisance of themselves by sitting on Japan's reputation for safety and security should be thoroughly condemned.",1,1
"&gt; The juvenile stated in his answer that he was forced to ""drop out of high school"" and suffered ""disruption of his peaceful life,"" as stated at the beginning of his answer.Who caused the disruption of his peaceful character in the first place?Why are you playing the victim when you yourself caused it?I know lawyers have to do what they have to do as part of their job, but this defense is going to cause even more public outcry and make the impression worse.In recent years, there have been many cases where the perpetrator acts like a victim and the real victim suffers even more damage, but it is the victim who should be protected.It is the victim's right to claim for the actual damage caused in order to improve the image of the damaged store.I only hope that a just judgment for damages will be rendered.",1,1
"There is no need to defend them. What they are doing is no different from the bite terrorism. If you don't change all the bottles, it will spread and people who saw the video will be uncomfortable, and some people will still be suspicious. In fact, some people were told that the store was closed after the ""Bite Terror"" incident and that it was a terrible thing to be in the news.",1,1
"If only the perpetrators are being defended, it is only because the reporting is biased.Since both sides have arguments and are in dispute, it is only natural that each side will say what suits them best, and even if the sentence is reduced due to social sanctions, it does not mean that the amount of damages for the victim will be reduced.",1,1
"I don't care if they got social sanctions. As for the company, their stock price is down.I think there are many people who would say they have no intention of going there if they were forced to watch that video.I can't tell you how much damage they've done with all the rumors.",1,1
"In addition to restoring trust in hygiene, the decline in sales is due to the damage to the image caused by this video before any competitive factors. The stock price has already told the story. The more they argue against it, the bigger boomerang will come back to the boy's side.",1,1
"A completely out of line objection.You can no longer escape responsibility.Think of it as fate, change your mindset, work hard, earn money, and repay the debt in order to seriously compensate for it.We can still change the future.You can become the president of your own company and contribute to society, and you will get the money.",1,1
"In the Showa period, if a child misbehaved, the owner would scold him or her, and then the parents would scold him or her further, and it was not uncommon for the child to be rehabilitated.Nowadays, however, videos remain and spread, so evacuations occur one after another and there is no escape.As a result, the damage to the stores spreads.",1,1
"The only way to prevent a recurrence is to pay a large amount of compensation.Unauthorized parking of cars, too, you have signs with fines, if no punishment is given, it will be parked all over the place, I think so.The same goes for parking on the street; if there is a punishment, I'm going to stop doing it.",1,1
"I believe the trial is to prevent similar shenanigans from happening in the future. This is not limited to the restaurant industry, but extends to the entire corporate world. If you are going to argue against this, it means that the perpetrator has no remorse at all, even though he may regret it.",1,1
"Trust comes first in business.The basic premise is safety and security, and only then can customers enjoy the experience.It may not be just this time, and it is a matter of course.Everything is the result of building up trust.I don't want you to whine now after you have done something to undermine Sushiro's credibility.",1,1
The article doesn't even remotely include the perspective of holding those responsible for spreading it.I think you need to study up and start over.The one who spread the newsThe minor and his right of publicity are sufficient to pursue the case.Both the boy and Sushiro deserve to be sued.The compensation willmay bridge the gap between the punishment that Sushiro seeks and the punishment that the juvenile deserves.,1,1
"By the way, how much are the damages for those old men in the Olympic corruption that is no longer even talked about?　If it's this amount for this case, I'd say about 1 trillion.　At least 200 million dollars in bribes, and they are actually causing great harm to all the citizens of Japan. This is a very bad case that even broke the trust of Japan, so if you punish them severely, please make it severe here too.",1,1
"No, isn't the damage done to the company and the social sanctions completely different?A society in which hundreds of millions of yen in damages can be forgiven if a person spends his or her days reflecting on his or her actions is just plain wrong, no matter how you think about it.If a company is big enough, even if it suffers damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars, should it be forgiven because ""he's a juvenile""?Isn't that strange?Frankly speaking, I think that even compensation of 67 million yen is a lenient amount when you consider the stock price that fell and the impact afterwards.I think those who are defending the company are lacking in ethical sense.",1,1
"Well, the lawyer's job is to defend you and reduce the amount as much as possible, so I'm going to blame you for that one.That in itself is not important.It's up to the judge to decide what to do with the claim.The fact is, until just before the Sushi-Pero fiasco, Sushi-Pero had been in trouble for bait advertisements and false advertisements.",1,1
"The high school expulsion and the self-proclaimed ""disruption of his peaceful life"" were only the result of what he had done and had nothing to do with the damage he had caused.The subject should be the method and amount of calculation of the damage incurred, and there is no remorse, ""because he is a juvenile,"" or ""I feel sorry for him"" involved.Victim relief is the first priority.If it's okay to not fully recover the damages inflicted on others, then the person who did everything wins.",1,1
"Not only boys, but also babies and toddlers may unintentionally lick the containers. Do you replace the containers in all your restaurants each time that happens? I think the problem is not so much the act as it is the concern about sanitation for the patrons due to the spreading of the video. The boy who licked the container will be punished, but the sanctions against those who spread the video are not well reported. I think the highlight of the trial will be whether the cost of improving sanitation constitutes damages. I would think that if you are damaged in a car accident, you can claim for those damages, but the additional cost of features such as improved safety for the next accident would be at your expense and not guaranteed.",1,1
"You say you were expelled from high school and inhibited from peace and quiet.That's exactly what you deserve, isn't it?Sushiro didn't ask for this.It's because the video went viral and became the talk of the town.If you want me to take that into considerationIf you want me to take that into consideration, you're out of line.At the very least, when customers go to a restaurantI hope you will think about the seasoning, chopsticks, etc. and chopsticks, etc., when they go to a restaurantI am sure that it is not only in restaurants.Not only in restaurantsentertainment, leisure, etc.One bad thing can ruin 100 good things.1 bad thing can ruin 100 good things.He really can't go out for sushi and enjoy the food as much as before.and enjoy the same delicious food as before?to enjoy the same delicious food as before?Without considering such invisible damageand interfere with his own daily peace of mindWho can say that?You don't really feel sorry for yourself, do you?You don't know exactly what is happening first.Give us back our peace and quiet, our food and drink.",1,1
"Ultimately, the court will make the decision, but since this is a civil matter, if Sushiro's side feels that this is the extent of the damage, they should claim that much.In the first place, they should have just not done such a stupid thing, but now that they have done it, they have no choice but to take appropriate responsibility.The outcome of the trial will depend on how hard both sides' lawyers work, but the boy's side should just wait and see.",1,1
"&gt; Furthermore, the juvenile stated in his answer that he was forced to ""drop out of high school"" and suffered ""disruption of his peaceful life,"" as stated at the beginning of his answer.Well, rather than the assailant's idea, the assailant's side just went along with the lawyer's strategy to limit the damage without thinking.It is clear that the perpetrator is not sorry for anything.There is no way they can post on a social networking site that basically transmits to the whole world and say ""I don't think about spreading the news"".The court's decision will be interesting to see. I hope the judiciary will also judge the responsibility of the perpetrators.",1,1
"Originally, it was possible to file a proper criminal complaint.I think it's kind of compassionate of them to try to settle it with civil damages.I think it's a ""parent"" who is trying to come up with a counterargument like this.I can't feel any remorse there.Lawyers are supposed to try to lighten the load, but dismissing the claim is a bit much.",1,1
"I think it is possible to demand compensation in order to let people know that an act done without thinking and in the so-called ""groove"" can be such a big deal.There is no need to be reserved for those who can't (or won't) imagine the consequences of doing something like this.They mistakenly think that because they are boys, they are allowed to do whatever they want.Because he is a boy..."" is not acceptable.If ""because he is a boy..."" is accepted, the world will become a terrible place.What is wrong is wrong.I'm sorry.So please forgive me.",1,1
"I'm not trying to defend the Pero boy, and while I think Sushiro's response is the right thing to do.Dishes that someone has licked, usually in the mouth, can be washed normally, and soy sauce jugs (especially the ones that have seams) are not for those who don't want to feel bad about it.I would ask those who still think that it would be fine if it were washed, and that it would not be necessary to replace all soy sauce jugs, if they want to eat with a set of dishes cut out of a used toilet bowl.If the judge in this case comes up with a settlement that drastically reduces the amount of damages claimed because he is a juvenile or because he is remorseful, he should be remembered as the one who ruined Japan's food safety and exacerbated the trend.",1,1
"I think the amount for this boy is on the low side.If you calculate the damage, it would not be this much.However. I think it's strange that the other person who is involved in this is not punished in any way.At the very least, if he comes out and says that he did it too, I would think that he is feeling remorse, but I also wonder about the attitude of the person who spread the news that he had nothing to do with it.",1,1
"A nuisance that has been called ""byte terrorism"" and has been around for quite some time. And yet it happens again. Nowadays, it is unreasonable to say that they are not aware that they are a nuisance. They are doing it because they are aware that it is a nuisance. Therefore, I think they deserve social sanctions and compensation in their own way.",1,1
"I don't think Sushiro cares about social sanctions against the boy.If it were a criminal case, it would be a little understandable to consider social sanctions, but since you are claiming damages in a civil case, I don't think it matters at all that he is socially sanctioned.",1,1
"What is it? Isn't publishing a detailed article about the trial itself an attempt by the media to lead public opinion? If they are writing articles that give the impression that the boy has no remorse at all by the way they phrase things or the way they write little articles, isn't this an act of slander and libel by the weekly magazines and the media, and isn't this a criminal act? Isn't it?",1,1
"Putting aside the amount, those who defend the perpetrators must be people who don't care much about this kind of behavior, right?I mean, this time it's a chain store run by a corporation.What would you do if they did it in your store?Would you be able to forgive the perpetrator if you lost customers and had to close your store because of it?What they are doing is more than a nuisance, it's a crime, isn't it?It may be my job as a lawyer, but I'm not sure I'd be able to explain why I'm spreading the word on the Internet, and I'm not sure I'd be able to explain why the school expelled him from high school if he had committed the crime.It's not right to blame Sushiro for making things bigger than they are.Those who think it's a good thing and speak out must have a similar mindset to the perpetrator (a little self-centeredness, if not to the extreme, thinking they are not causing trouble when they are causing others trouble), right?There are a number of revolving restaurants, and customers go where they want to go.However, I don't go to such a restaurant (chain restaurant) anymore.I think there are a lot of people like that.",1,1
"Isn't there something one-sided about this article?Of course, I agree with myself that the basic premise is that the juvenile side is to blame, and public opinion is undeniably that of the judge.However, the law also protects the human rights of the wrongdoers, and I think this is where the difference in interpretation comes in.First of all, I don't know what exactly the article is referring to when it says that the media is conspicuous in its defense of the perpetrator, but the media and the trial must be viewed from a neutral standpoint, and while it is implicit that the juvenile is at fault, there are some things that can be understood by viewing it from the juvenile's perspective. I think it is important to understand that the media and the trial must be seen from a neutral standpoint.The media is entertainment if it is a wide show, so it would not be interesting to say something so obvious that the juvenile is at fault.Also, some people would lawlessly execute juveniles, so it would be unwise to make such heated comments.I also think it's not a good idea to take a part of the statement and stir things up unnecessarily, as in the second half of the article.",1,1
"It's an act that could have cost him a billion dollars in compensation if he were in the country.You should know that there are so many risks involved in such a nuisance, and you should still be glad that the person who says he used the perused soy sauce cup without knowing about it is not suing him for compensation.",1,1
"The question is whether the share price will recover if the company reflects on its actions, and whether the shareholders who lost a lot of money will be able to recover their losses.All I can say to the boy is one word: ""Too shallow.",1,1
"Well, I hope that the public will not only see the reduction, but also the dismissal of the claim and the need to take such action. I hope that the public will not take it as a sign of lack of remorse on the part of the juvenile, and that the juvenile will not be rehabilitated without sufficient remorse.Personally, I would not be happy if the juvenile is rehabilitated without sufficient remorse.",1,1
"Even if the boy who caused the damage had been expelled from school, it would be for his own self-preservation,It has absolutely no effect on Sushiro to reduce the damage.Therefore, it cannot be a story of discounting easy damages.Those who insist on defending the boy,If you want to protect this boy, you should compensate him and his parents for the damages.",1,1
"Furthermore, that the boy's side was forced to ""drop out of high school"" as I mentioned at the beginning of this article.Isn't it completely your fault on this one? Even if it hadn't been taken so far, he would have been expelled from school. I think he would have been expelled sooner or later.",1,1
"I don't feel like going to Sushiro or to Hama Sushi anymore after this issue.I have nothing to do with either side of this issue, but this is an incident, and the fact that it caused a loss of over 10 billion even temporarily is what the victim side is talking about.If it was done by a wealthy person who can compensate for the loss, it might be forgiven, but this is a serious terrorist act against the social distribution economy, and there is nothing we can do about it.",1,1
"What is the lawyer's job?Wouldn't this kind of defense policy only make the boy and the family look bad?Still, if they are being asked to lower the amount of compensation anyway, maybe this kind of argument is the only weapon they have.",1,1
"The ""why did you replace all the bottles?"" is an insane objection.I don't understand the lawyer who said that.I don't understand the lawyer who said that. I don't know if he was just bitter because he couldn't think of anything else, or if he's a bad person who really thought that way. .........Even if Sushiro had said, ""We replaced the subject bottles,"" many people would have doubts about whether the rest of the bottles were really OK.So it affected sales.This time, it was only discovered because the culprit posted it on social networking sites, but until then, it was an act that had gone unnoticed.It was so out of the ordinary that most people would never even think of it, but the fact that someone actually did it was a shock to the public.No one could answer the question, ""Well, what about the past?"" No one can answer the question, ""Well, what about the past?It had to be replaced.Otherwise, Sushiro would not be able to restore its image and would be left with a weak point.I think they should take responsibility because it is not a case of ""an infant took his eyes off the road for a moment..."".The amount of compensation is reasonable.That's all I did.",1,1
"It may be a deterrent, but it's too sensitive! The peropero incident was a few years ago and was spread by a famous influencer, but, I don't know if I'd go that far against an individual. The reason why I originally stopped going to Sushiro...I'll tell you now, I stopped going there because the plates with sushi on them were not clean and small cockroaches were coming out of the crevices. I thought about taking a video and spreading the word... but I left the restaurant without even telling the employees!Sushiro's price increase is very noticeable these days... and I don't feel like going there!",1,1
"The whole bottle thing is because if the boy is a regular, he could be getting his hands all over the place, and because it's so widespread across the country, customers are resistant to it, and it's hard to use. It's a natural thought for people who work in the restaurant industry. People who haven't experienced it don't think that far ahead, so it's a shallow accusation. By ""rebuttal,"" do you mean you don't reflect on what you're saying?",1,1
"The boy's side says he was expelled from high school, disruption of his peaceful life, etc., but it is not Sushiro's fault.But the replacement of the soy sauce bottle is definitely the boy's fault.If the boy's fault is that it was spread, then he should sue the famous influencer. You are missing the point.",1,1
"When I heard that the claim amount was 67 million yen, my first thought was that it was surprisingly small. If the assailant's side shows such resistance as an accusation, wouldn't it be better to raise the claim amount more and fight it thoroughly?",1,1
"The public should not defend it.The court will decide the rest.Once the verdict is made...I hope that each school and school board will use this example to educate students and students about society.For that reason, I hope that the court will issue a verdict that minimizes the mercy of the situation.",1,1
"Even though they have received social sanctions, do they still have to cry themselves to sleep for damages for the loss of sales in that section?If we allow that to happen, there will be no end to it. The trial should continue.They'll probably settle anyway, but we have to keep in mind that they're going to be asked to pay so much in damages.",1,1
"The reason for this is that the case is a ""civil"" one, and the ""harm to the rehabilitation of the juvenile"" does not fit the theory at all.In the example of ""if it were in other countries,"" as people on the left often say, punitive damages would be imposed, so the amount of damages would be double the amount of damages suffered by the industry, not the amount of damages reported by a single company, as is common practice.It is perfectly understandable under Japan's current legal system that the party being sued tries to lighten the penalty somehow, or that it ignores the facts and defends itself according to the same policy, but every time I see such a bad move, I feel that ""the complicated legal system itself, which requires so-called experts such as lawyers, is problematic.",1,1
"Diffusion is unexpected. I am sorry if I didn't spread it. It is not a matter that can be forgiven by saying, ""I'm sorry if I don't spread the word.Did he apologize and say, ""I'll work for free at this store for a year, even washing dishes or cleaning?No, right? Expelled from high school? This has nothing to do with it either. This is not compulsory education, and he dropped out voluntarily, right? You can't say that you took responsibility just because of this. If you want, you can take the entrance exam for another school or take the graduation exam. First of all, this person and his family should think about and face the distinction between pranks that are allowed even for students and acts that are now considered crimes.",1,1
"High school dropout"" and ""disruption of peaceful living.""Isn't this something caused by the perpetrator or done by the perpetrator himself?Also, it is a claim for compensation for the act itself, regardless of whether or not there was any intent to spread it.The replacement of all the soy sauce, etc. is also unavoidable because it is impossible to specify which of the soy sauce, etc. is the target or whether it was a one-time act (i.e., whether it was done only this time or whether it was done in the past as well). (And even if they declared that it was a one-time only act, they would not be trustworthy in the first place.)So, we have no choice but to hold them accountable with gusto. Well, it's still a pretty warm amount of money.",1,1
"I live near the store where the damage was done.It is a little different to say that because he is a juvenile, he should be forgiven already because he has already been expelled from school and has received social sanctions...You are free to argue if you want, but I think it is hard to get sympathy.",1,1
"Sushiro's side wants to get a judgment with a large amount of compensation to prevent a recurrence and deter it. But they have little intention of making them pay the full amount. They will make them pay to some extent, but after a year or two, they will say ""enough is enough"" and give up, but don't talk about it. Then the only thing that will remain on the table is that the nuisance is a very expensive compensation. I'm sure the lawyers know what they're doing, but the boy's side is trying too hard.",1,1
"This case is not for show, but for actual damages.Whether it is a juvenile or an old man, he will only be compensated for the full amount of the damage he caused. If the case drags on any longer, they will probably charge additional fees for the personnel involved in the trial.",1,1
"As long as this boy can't prove that he didn't lick the other bottles, it's only natural for the store to replace them all. Only he knows he didn't lick them, and he can't be trusted as it is.There's no point in hiring a lawyer who can only fry a guy like that, because there's no way he can win. If you don't come up with the money soon, there will be more.",1,1
"Maybe it's the result of the lawyer's forced defense, but if they say that there is no need to replace all the bottles or that there are other reasons for the decrease in sales, I think it will only make the boy's impression worse.It's as if he's saying that he's opening up and that he's a victim too.",1,1
"Sushiro, on the customer's side, was prevented from eating out peacefully.made it difficult to go out to eat because of the anxietyThey were forced to replace the cameras and disinfect them.The stock price of 16 billion yen is noteworthy, but in fact, if security cameras and other expenses were spent at all stores nationwide, the 60 million yen this time would be reasonable or even less than that.The boy's argument is selfishness itself.",1,1
"I hear that the damage itself is not so much estimated... but it will be a deterrent in the future, won't it?What happens when someone uses a ""sticky"" soy sauce jug? It will come back to haunt you...I just ask for a deterrent decision.",1,1
"After this incident, I stopped going to sushi restaurants for a while, not only Sushiro. Just looking at the conveyor belt sushi lane made me sick. Recently, I have finally been able to go there again, but I think there are many people who have stopped going to conveyor belt sushi restaurants like I did.",1,1
"If we don't take any measures, we'll be called out a lot for our lack of crisis management awareness, so I think it's wonderful that we took thorough countermeasures.I think it's great that they took thorough countermeasures. It is also necessary to let people know the risk of disclosing such acts and videos in the future, including in the past.I can't believe I can say it's funny when I shouldn't have done it in the first place.I think I've seen him say something like he's sorry before, but I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do, because it's not about words, but about actions that make people think he's sorry.",1,1
"I mean, I don't care if it's more expensive the other way around.Charge whatever you think the boy may have caused,(I don't think you can make it higher now.)You can also refute the questions with neat answers.If you want to win with the lawyer the company hires, you should hire a good one.",1,1
"I'm sure the perpetrator will argue. It's a pretty hard mode of life. But whether the perpetrator is expelled or not is the perpetrator's problem, not the victim's. At any rate, I don't know about the negative impact of that video in the moment, but in the long run, I think the damage could be as much as a hundred million dollars.",1,1
"All perpetrators? What are you talking about? I want to say. The fact that they broke the myth of safety in the restaurant industry in Japan is really serious. The fine is so low. If you know how many people are worried about the cleanliness of the dishes and whether they are contaminated, what they did cannot be called a ""prank"". After watching that video, we can no longer go back to the days when we enjoyed eating out under the absolute safety and security of the past in Japan.I still want them to make it clear that they shouldn't do what they shouldn't do and that what is wrong is wrong.Their lives may have been ruined, but how many people were involved in serving sushi at a restaurant called Sushiro? If there were people who lost their jobs and ruined their lives just because they could not see it, can we say that the price of their ""prank"" was too much and that we feel sorry for them?",1,1
"In all likelihood, it was the boy's fault. Yes, he probably didn't expect such a commotion, and it may have been just a little prank.But for the person who was hit, it was more than just a little prank. The reason you quit the school was not because Sushiro told you to stop. You quit because it became difficult for you to go there, and it was all your fault.You did a terrible thing.",1,1
"Q: Why defend only the perpetrators?A:I don't know what ""only"" means, but in a nutshell, it's because there is a lack of balance between ""crime"" and ""punishment.I mean, purely in terms of the act done, the act of ""spreading"" is probably more culpable than the act of ""licking"". It should fall under the category of ""obstruction of business.Because it should be. If it is only the act of ""licking"", it may or may not fall under the category of ""destruction of property"". The bottom line is that the shop should pay for the damages (replacement of the soy sauce bottle) and apologize to the customer. Naturally, the store should be compensated for the damages, but I think the ratio of responsibility for damages should be ""2 for the boy and 8 for the third party who maliciously ""spread"" the information.",1,1
"It's not just a Sushiro problem.There could have been customers who used teacups or ate sushi with spit on it after that.It's naive to think that, and in the first place, they must have known that they shouldn't have done it, no matter how underage they were.",1,1
"It is not right to say at this stage that the perpetrator has been punished enough.　I believe that the punishment the perpetrator has received is still a work in progress.　I believe that only after the perpetrator has been punished by the judiciary, has made amends for his crime, and has repaid the victim, should he be said to have been sufficiently punished.　The media should defend the victims, not the perpetrators.",1,1
"As far as your rebuttal goes, is it true that you are remorseful on a daily basis? If you admit everything and ask for a reduction in your bill, or if you say that it is not your fault that the number of customers has decreased and that the replacement of all soy sauce is too excessive, are you really sorry for what you have done? If an apology would suffice, the person who was hit would not be happy. Who pays the wages for the response work done by the employees? The compensation should be repaid, not for the rest of their lives, but with a little bit of their own future earnings, that's the way of the world.",1,1
"The boy's act, even if unintentional, is a challenge to the food culture of our country.is a challenge to our nation's food culture, even if unintentional.to the food culture of our country, even if it was unintentional.There is a heavy price to pay, but it is unavoidable.I hope that the compensation is large enough to prevent copycats.to prevent copycats.",1,1
"Why forget the criminal act of deceiving consumers caused by Sushiro's 2022,Sushiro itself originally cheated its customers and lost their trust.The president of Sushiro never apologized or held a press conference or anything like that, and the company just took a licking,Frankly, as the boy says, what Sushiro did was just an overreaction,It's a problem with a specific part of a specific store, and yet, while other companies have installed acrylic panels, etc., from the Corona vortex, Sushiro is trying to make the perpetrator bear 100% of the burden of all the problems?I'm just plain don't get it. I think the decline in sales is due to the fact that the competition, or rather Sushiro, was cheating their customers, which is why they were losing customers in the first place.",1,1
"I think the charge from Sushiro's side is quite gentle.If the spread was unexpected, isn't it the influencer who spread it, not Sushiro, who bites?Why don't you take the bill for what you did neatly and tell the influencer, ""If only you hadn't spread the word!"" And why don't you file a lawsuit?The fact that you did it will never go away.",1,1
"I would like to ask those who are on the side of the perpetrator's defense...Would you hesitate to use a restaurant that has been the victim of an act that involves food hygiene?Would you be able to say the same thing if you were a shareholder or in a management position?Would you say the same thing if you were an employee of the restaurant?Would the restaurant want to use the person who is causing trouble by making him do the dishes or carry-in work to rehabilitate him?It sounds good to say it's for rehabilitation, but don't you think it's disrespectful to the person originally doing the job to treat it like a punishment?People who say things like ""because he's a juvenile..."" or ""rehabilitation is..."" are saying it because they themselves are in a place where they have nothing to do with it, right?From the point of view of the people involved, it's not just a matter of ""juvenile's over-the-top pranks!",1,1
"I thought being a lawyer was a job where you memorize the law and pass the exam, and then you don't have to use your head?How do you feel about the fact that Sushiro has been forced to ""tighten sanitation control in all its restaurants"" and that they are suffering from ""disruption of peaceful commerce""?And if the perpetrators are ""asked to explain"" why they left high school without being asked, will they answer?",1,1
">""We demand an explanation as to why all soy sauce bottles were discarded and replaced.""I see what you mean.It would be understandable if Sushiro replaced only the bottles that had been licked by the boy, but the fact that it replaced even the bottles that had not been licked by the boy suggests that Sushiro was aware that other people had done the same thing, and that it had failed to take countermeasures against it.If the company knew about the malicious person's presence, but failed to take countermeasures and compromised the safety of customers, the company ""would"" be slammed as well.If the boy also licked other bottles, then Sushiro needs to prove it. Japanese law does not hold a company responsible for a crime it did not commit.The boy's lawyer is doing a good job.",1,1
"It's not even that I think this is a good thing to do in the first place, and I wonder if the people defending this would be able to stand it if someone spit on their sushi! It could be taken to mean that you can defend someone because it's someone else's problem, or because you have the same mindset! In fact, when I think about how much care Sushiro and the chain restaurants that suffered this damage took and put myself in the employee's shoes, I can't really protect them.",1,1
"Well, if you're going to be so hard on an individual to the point of ending their lifeIf you are going to be so hard on an individual to the point of ending his or her life,It would be unfair if we were to be so hard on a company that we would destroy it.Dentsu and AOKI, who made use of the taxpayers' money for the Olympics.I would be satisfied with the criticism of individuals by these companies if they had been destroyed.I'm so lenient on corporations, aren't I?",1,1
"Sushiro only managed to withstand the reputational damage because of its large scale. If it were a medium-sized or smaller restaurant, it would have gone under due to reputational damage.If Sushiro had gone under, you wouldn't have defended it, right? All the employees could have been laid off.That's the kind of problem this is.",1,1
"My guess is that the soy sauce bottles were regularly collected and their contents replenished or cleaned. When the incident was discovered, it was too late to determine which bottle it was. Therefore, I understand that all the bottles were replaced. It is a weak defense even though you are a lawyer....Good luck!",1,1
"Since the possibility of such mischief exists, we have no choice but to replace all the products, even if it means that both customers and stores have been made aware of the possibility of such mischief.",1,1
"The reason why the damage to Sushiro was tens or hundreds of millions of dollars is because the news media reported this case without considering the victim's side. Was it really reporting for the sake of justice? It was just a matter of increasing viewer ratings and such, wasn't it?To be honest, the extent of the fire on social networking sites didn't cause this much damage.There are probably far more people who found out about it from TV news or articles on the Internet than from social networking sites.And yet, they feel guilty about putting the blame on the boy alone, which is why the media will probably have some defensive opinions.I'm rather afraid of the Internet articles that incite the lynch-loving netizens at this stage of the game.",1,1
"Some customers won't be convinced unless you say that all the bottles have been replaced, and Sushiro is not overreacting.I'm sure there are people who saw the video and stopped going to Sushiro because they thought some people might copy their behavior.",1,1
"Wouldn't it have been better to have the initial claim amount of 167 million yen if the amount of compensation was to be reduced in the end anyway?The amount of compensation for the act of making the public feel so bad that they can't go there may be astronomical....First of all, the news of replacing all the containers was a relief, and now it seems that the customers are coming back much more.",1,1
"It is laughable to think that after causing such a public and social uproar, he would be so remorseful that he would shelve his own actions and refute them.The damage done to Sushiro is irreversible. I am also a fan of Sushiro and have been going there since the incident, but after the incident, the staff at the restaurant seems to be tense and I am not going to go there any more.I posted this on social media just for the fun of it! Is it possible that an act done in the heat of the moment or to gain popularity can do so much damage and tarnish the image of the company? Do you understand what others have pointed out? The power of influence and diffusion cannot be underestimated.I know you say that you have received enough social sanctions. Even if you are sanctioned, you can recover from it. But if a company's image is damaged, it means trust and customers will never come back. I would like him to accept the mistake he made seriously before making a counterargument, but is that too much to ask?",1,1
"If it wasn't intended to spread, then you could charge the friend who spread it.Well, the boy's side wants to reduce the amount as much as possible, so they'll argue this way.It'll be interesting to see what kind of verdict they come up with.This trial will be a guideline for the future.",1,1
"The replacement of all the bottles, ""Do we really need to go that far?"" is not a decision to be made by the perpetrator. The victim felt it was necessary as a business decision, so he did it.The juvenile's side should not make any unnecessary objection, but only ask for a reduction in the amount of reimbursement, using ""remorse"" and ""social sanctions"" as a shield. Otherwise, the possibility of renewed attacks on the juvenile is predictable from the comments here.",1,1
"You have taken an attitude that you probably should not have said or taken.If you really want me to forgive you and reduce the amount of compensation.If I had just said, ""It's my fault,"" and apologized immediately, even though I knew it would not be enough, I might have been inclined to say, ""Let's have him apologize and leave it to me from now on,"" even though I have been bad-mouthing him again, but his attitude this time was, ""I have no remorse. I read in the reply to my post in the other section that he can be rehabilitated even without the payment of 67,000,000 yen, but I thought ""rehabilitated with this attitude?　Hmm? I have the impression that the company can be rehabilitated even without the 67 million yen payment.I don't think the boy can be rehabilitated without payment of either the 67 million yen currently being offered or the full amount in hundreds of millions of yen.And even if that is not 100 percent possible, I think it should have a small deterrent effect (and that would also mean not making even one person a criminal).",1,1
"So how do you know which bottle of soy sauce you licked the other way around? You don't know, so you had to change all the bottles. What evidence do you have that the decline in sales is due to competition? There are many people who say they don't want to go there because of the decrease in sales after this incident. If there are some words on social networking sites in defense of the boy, please put them on here and show us the id or something, I doubt if it's true. And I'm not sure if it's true or not. How do we know if he's really sorry? He may just be saying he's sorry because his parents told him to.He did something he shouldn't have done because he's a juvenile or whatever. I don't know what's going to happen in the trial, but you'd better reflect well on what you've done.",1,1
"I don't know about you, but for now, I hope you get justice just right and settle down with a job or something just right so you don't become an invincible person.I'm afraid I'll become an invincible person if I have to pay a large sum of money as a consolation prize after being beaten so severely.",1,1
"I thought you didn't have to drop out of school, but I thought your parents decided to do it because it would be a problem for the school. I hope you will study properly by re-enrolling in a correspondence course or taking a high school equivalency exam, that's your choice regardless of Sushiro.",1,1
"They are afraid of copycats, right?Even if the stores don't think so, the customers do, so they have no choice but to do so.It is extremely difficult to prove this, but it is an undeniable reality.If it is not the suspect's responsibility, then the ""accomplices"" must be acquitted of all charges.Well, I think that's what lawyers say on their own, but if that's what he says, it can only be taken as ""he has no intention of remorse.Well, the lawyer has nothing to do with it.They are hired to do a job on the ""there is a reason for it"" vector.It is reasonable to hold the suspect accountable for that.It would be better for the future if we know that there are cases where lawyers pile up the charges against the accused.If you are saying, ""Why are you going to go that far with a child? If you are saying, ""Why are you so hard on a child?"" then you should look for another remedy.If that's the case, we'll end up in a world where you have to sleep in a chair with one eye open when you sleep in your own home.",1,1
"＞On the other hand, even at this stage of the game, the media is still conspicuous in its defense of the perpetrators.Is that so? I think there is a lot of coverage that basically blames the juvenile.The juvenile's lawyer's defense is a legitimate assertion of his rights as the party being sued, but many media outlets are reporting it as if it were an escape from responsibility or an excuse.But just because public opinion is leaning toward Sushiro, it doesn't mean that the trial will go that way.Also, they make it sound like the trial has already started, but they haven't even set a trial date yet, have they?Will the trial be prolonged with both sides at odds?I think Sushiro intends to settle early. Especially if the defendants really take a confrontational stance, they'll go for a settlement right away.Because there's no way they can see their side of the story from the start.",1,1
"There are those who criticize Sushiro's damages, saying, ""I'm really disappointed in Sushiro for charging the boy this much money,"" ""He wants to go that far and look like a good person,"" and ""I'm so shallow in my thinking that I'm in awe. Are you a relative of the boy? Frankly, it was a sickening video. Let's extend the calculation a bit more, for future deterrence.",1,1
"Even those who didn't put it on social media did.The stores should have taken action mechanically and humanly long ago.They thought about making a profit and put off awareness of the crisis, and it paid off. When selling food, it is normal to see it in front of you or wrap it.",1,1
"That brings us back to the beginning, doesn't it?Why did I lick it?　Without that reason, there would have been no change, no lawsuit.　I understand what you are saying, but the calculation of compensation in Japan is based only on the actual amount of damage, so it seems to me that this is inevitable.　There is no compensation for reputational damage or loss of turnover, so perhaps defamation would have been better than compensation for damages.",1,1
"I don't blame the boy for being punished.However, I think it is out of line for him to be punished as a ""representative of people who cause trouble"".And as for the cost of installing the acrylic panels, I think the fact that no measures were taken for the lanes in the first place is not good hygiene management.Even if it wasn't a prank, it would have been covered in other people's saliva droplets.",1,1
"The way this kind of article is written, I think it is an incitement to make the reader feel as if the juvenile is not remorseful and is arguing against it.I don't mean to defend the juvenile at all, but it is the lawyers who are ranting and raving, not the juvenile.I think it's only natural for the juvenile to ask the lawyer to do something about it.",1,1
"> He also states that he had no ""intention"" to share this ""nuisance"" with many people through the Internet, and that he did not anticipate its spread. He also said that the spread was caused by a well-known influencer, and that the spread was not the boy's intention.Yes? The spread was unforeseen in the first place.Not, just unimaginative.It's a problem when you're doing something you shouldn't be doing, and if you put it up for even a second, even if it's under lock and key, it's a digital tattoo.Your own followers' followers... you don't know, do you?What are you talking about when you do something you shouldn't have done in the first place?If you were in your normal senses, you wouldn't even do that.Dropping out of high school? If you want to go there so badly, just take the entrance exam again.You brought this on yourself.Besides, it's okay.It's only a little luxury house, so you can pay it back with work.You have to clean up your own mess.You don't feel sorry for yourself.",1,1
"Since this is a trial, there may be unreasonable objections.Lawyers are supposed to make proposals and act with the client's best interest in mind, so there is no need for the outside world to yell at reckless objections.It will be interesting to see how the case turns out.",1,1
"Simply put, I understand the claim for damages to the stores done by this high school student.I'm just wondering if the actions such as changing bottles in all stores after this incident were simply capital investments, and if the high school student should be charged for those investments.",1,1
"Why did you replace all the bottles...?If I didn't get them replaced, I still wouldn't be able to go to Sushiro now.I had them replaced, and I am now going to Sushiro with peace of mind because I did not forgive the perpetrator and demanded compensation for the damages.The amount of damages is not very much, though...",1,1
"People who defend you are just drunk on themselves with righteousness and kind words. They can say anything they want. If they are going to defend, they should sue with their real names, and if they want, they should compensate the damaged companies alone.",1,1
"Hmmm...The company has been generous up until now, but finally lost its temper! I guess you could say that...Well, I guess they are no longer allowed to do what they used to be allowed to do, and the reason that it was just a juvenile prank is no longer valid, and the company is no longer allowed to do so.Compared to those who were not charged that much, it seems unfair, but I guess there is a big element of luck too.Half a gureki? I don't know if it's a half-legit or a big one. I don't know if it's half-breed or big-breed, but the cost of this is huge.I'm sure the parents are crying too.I wonder if the bill will be as much as 150 million yen. I don't think they can afford it.I don't know if the parents will be compensated, but it's too big a sum.It's a rough society.No matter how hard parents try to discipline their children, some of them just don't listen.I guess that's why they do things like this, though.",1,1
">""We demand an explanation as to why all soy sauce bottles were discarded and replaced.＞The author believes that Sushiro is seeking damages more than money in hopes of deterring the restaurant, worker, and consumer safety in Japan, as well as any behavior that threatens it.You know what? The law can only judge on the facts. Deterrence means to suppress the nuisances that will occur in the future, in other words, you are judging future crimes. In other words, in legal terms, you are ""over-sanctioning.I don't think so.The restaurant business is built on an unspoken trust. If even one of the 30 bottles is found to have been tainted without being noticed, even if that bottle is replaced with a new one, the suspicion that there may be other tainted bottles cannot be removed. So, I think the only way to restore trust was to replace them all.",1,1
"I think the defense lawyers are leading you on, but if you are living a life of remorse, you would not have these objections. It was a completely intentional act, and he posted it on a social networking site because he thought people would find it interesting. You should be punished for it. There are many things in this world that cannot be undone. Rust from the body. I don't even want to feel sorry for him, and I shouldn't.",1,1
"If my house was burglarized and there were signs that the dishes had been licked, I would at least replace all the dishes.You never know what they are doing to you.I'm like this even with things I use, so I'd probably do the same with things I serve to my customers.",1,1
"Is this boy really remorseful?I don't feel like he's remorseful in any way.It's all his own fault for causing such a nuisance that was spread in the first place, and since he offended so many people by interfering with food safety for the nuisance, he should take it in stride and spend the rest of his life making amends!",1,1
"It is a strange situation where Sushiro, the victim, has to take care of the perpetrator for some reason.It would be easier to gain understanding if the victim is helped first and then the perpetrator is taken care of.",1,1
"I think Sushiro has failed. The more media coverage there is of this, the more customers will flee. And the more it is reported that the stock price decline is partly due to a fake campaign scam, the worse it will be. If Sushiro is going to sue, it needs to do so with an eye on the bottom line. If this story drags on to the Supreme Court and is reported in the press, it will be an endless hell for Sushiro.",1,1
"I don't think most people understand that it's the worst thing they could have done during a pandemic!I have to reiterate that the ""terror video"" is proof that it literally could have been a mass murder.It's not like other excessive flame wars where the critics are more vicious.In Japan, it will be reduced a lot because of the small-town-friendly nature of the country, but overseas, it would really be close to 100 million dollars.",1,1
"I believe he initially told us that he did it because he thought it would be interesting.In other words, he must have decided that it was something that he would not normally do, something unusual.Because doing something normal is not interesting.Also, saying that he had no intention of spreading the news is also an impossible excuse as long as he posted it on Twitter. If I had to say, all the members who were present with the boy are responsible.",1,1
"There's an image on the customer's side, so it's only natural to swap out the bottles.The right thing to do would be to make all the soy sauce and gari in individual packages, but they would look the same as the ones sold in supermarkets and convenience stores.Sales have been adversely affected by our competitors, so it's not surprising that we're getting claims for damages from other companies.We're only going to be socially sanctioned as well.It's going to affect my future employment and stuff.You'll be rejected from the entry sheet, and even part-time workers will not hire you for fear of being a part-time terrorist.You're taking customer service too far.",1,1
"I used to go to Sushiro about every month, but not once after this incident. And I don't think I will go there again. Of course, it is because of the incident. I realized the danger of assuming that others have no malicious intent.So Sushiro has definitely suffered a loss.",1,1
"The people who say it's expensive are the ones who only see what's in the immediate future.There are more than 600 Sushiro stores in Japan, 67 million, 100,000 per store.Outsourcing disinfection, cleaning, cleaning and replacing equipment, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.In fact, the 67 million is a glimpse of Sushiro's kindness in consideration of the perpetrators.If you're serious, a hundred million is a piece of cake.",1,1
"&gt; The juvenile stated in his defense that he was forced to ""withdraw from high school"" and that he suffered ""disruption of his peaceful life,"" as stated at the beginning of this article.I don't think the school would want to keep a student like this.And they should realize the gravity of what they have done.The decrease in sales is due to competitive factors, but you don't want to do that.You say that the amount of money is too severe and that you should raise it, but that's because you don't feel any remorse.You have to make them understand the seriousness of the situation by the amount of money.",1,1

"The only thing I was expelled for was the social sanctions part I suffered!Sushiro has only apologized and has not been compensated for the damage he has caused!If you break something, restore the status quo!If you can't, we will compensate you!It's the same thing, isn't it?If you don't get a new soy sauce container, you will further damage it to the extent that you can't continue your business activities!The cost of purchasing all the soy sauce containers and compensation for labor and lost time due to the time employees spent cleaning and disinfecting them!We need to pay for this alone!No matter how much the amount is reduced from 6,000,000 yen, you should at least understand that the actual costs for the damage caused to the people involved must surely be paid, boy!",1,1
"I have been going to Uomai for a long time because it comes out directly and the ingredients are relatively large. (I'm not a turncoat. There are stores where the number of customers has increased and the employees are tired, perhaps because there are more people like that.) Originally, Sushiro's popularity has fallen because of bait-and-switch advertising, but, unless you're making it up, you can't just lick a public soy sauce jug, can you? What you are saying is so absurd that I wonder if it is intentional. If it wasn't a setup, I think he'll just be heavily compensated as a remorseless act.",1,1
"It's hard to pinpoint because we all have different perceptions of how much damage was done and by whom.The potential perpetrators are(1) Juvenile(2) Guardians (if they are grossly negligent as supervisors)(3) The person who took and released the video(4) Person who spreads the video (other than the media)(5) Person who spreads the video (mass media)Damages areA. Direct damages due to tortB. Indirect damages caused by the diffusion of the videoHowever, is it common knowledge that (3) to (5) are the perpetrators who spread the video (with malicious intent, knowing that the victims would be damaged by the spread of the video and not caring if they were damaged) for the damages in (B)?Even if there is no malicious intent, if a person spreads a video that causes damage to the victim, he or she is a perpetrator.",1,1
"I feel that the boy's actions had a considerable impact on the company's hygienic image as a result of the spread of the story, so I feel that he deserves to be compensated for his damages.However, if compensation is the price to be paid for his actions, I feel that it is necessary to follow up with the perpetrator after the details of the compensation have been determined in court.Even if it is possible that a student voluntarily quits school because he/she finds it difficult to stay there, it is not right for a third party to give a punishment other than what was decided in the judgment without permission.Even though it is true that the image of the perpetrator as a human being cannot be wiped out, I think it is important to have people who support the perpetrator so that he or she can make reparations on his or her own.",1,1

"It is the duty of the juvenile's attorney to make various defenses in favor of the juvenile.We calmly wrap our arms around the verdict.However, ""I feel sorry for the perpetrator"" is a different point of contention. The reason for feeling sorry for him is due to the actions of those who spread the distributed video and persistently slander him, and the juvenile should be able to claim damages for that as ""too much.But Sushiro is not the one who created the ""pitiful"" situation.",1,1
"It is clear that Sushiro does not want compensation for the damage.It is more likely that they want to let people know that the cost of the ""byte-terrorism"" that has been going on for more than 10 years now is very high. I cannot stand to see Japan being degraded by leftists who defend the perpetrators.",1,1
"I think it's a good idea to proceed as it works, and since the main purpose of a juvenile court is to proofread, it makes sense that the plaintiffs need to show material to reflect on.",1,1
"Sushiro does not want reimbursement. He is suing to prevent, or deter, a recurrence. The damage caused by the boy's favoritism may not be precisely calculated, but the market capitalization temporarily decreased by 15 billion yen, and sales dropped by a considerable amount. That alone is surely not at least 100 or 200 million yen.Why did they increase the amount of damages claimed? The reason is that the juvenile side showed an attitude of fighting. I don't know if this will deter them.Is anyone underestimating the boy's actions? Any large company can go out of fashion and go bankrupt. They go out of business by chance. Since the bubble economy, there have been many bankruptcies of big companies. There is a possibility that Sushiro will also decline because of this incident. If that happens, how many employees and people in related industries will be affected? Some people would be left on the street. What the boy did is an act that has the potential to destroy many families.",1,1

"I will donate 60 million yen to Sushiro. So please make the compensation for the boy 7 million yen.

"In a criminal case, the goal is to rehabilitate the offender, so there may be extenuating circumstances in the juvenile's favor, but in a civil trial, the goal is to compensate for the damages suffered, so if the juvenile had dropped out of high school, what does that have to do with the amount of damages?",1,1

"Well...the profession of a lawyer is not to administer the law for the sake of justice, but to interpret the law for the sake of the paying client, so perhaps it is inevitable to make such an argument.But it's still a strong argument, isn't it?The decline in sales due to customers' avoidance of Sushiro is ""the extremely subjective psychology of the users""...in other words, the users ""of their own accord"" did not go there, and therefore the defendant ""has nothing to do"" with the decline in sales. This is a very strong argument that would not be accepted in the general public, right?The defendant was forced to voluntarily drop out of school..."" That is a very personal matter for the defendant, and has nothing to do with Sushiro, right?Why did they exchange everything? Since the possibility is not zero, it is too natural to assume that other companies may have done the same thing, isn't it?This trial was clearly the defendant's fault, and there was no way to defend him, but since he was defended, he must have been forced to make a lot of strong arguments like this.Thank you for your efforts!",1,1

"This case is affecting more than just the stores in question.There is no way that 67 million dollars would be enough to cover the cost of countermeasures, falling stock prices, and so on.How can you say that the spread of the video was unintentional or that it was the competitor's fault?You know that you can't control the situation once the video is uploaded to the Internet.",1,1
"No matter how you try to excuse it, it is a fact that there were posts on the Internet immediately after the sushi terror report saying, ""I'm going to stop going to Sushiro for a while.If you insist that ""whether or not people actually stopped coming to Sushiro just because of the posts and whether or not there was a causal relationship to the decline in sales is another matter,"" then all I can say is that you have lost your train of thought.",1,1
"Why haven't social networking companies been sued?70% to 90% of the diffusion of clicks is due to recommendation algorithms.Boy. Furthermore, there is nothing sanitary or safe about these things left on desks in the first place. They are usually dirty. There needs to be a perspective that it should be a use-it-up type in the first place, and there is no denying the aspect of relying on a business model that relies on customer practices to cut down on the cost side. It is the business provider that has to hit the insurance against the problems of doing business with fewer people, and suing the boy is not the way to go.",1,1
"Sushiro nationwide stores stock price impact on a single store single time issue spreading misstatement is a problem.Then, whether it was a legal suspension by the health department, the daily unsanitary conditions of the employees' hands and tableware, or the mislabeling of foodstuffs, it is all about Sushiro's inability to manage the crisis.Sushiro's lack of crisis management is the end of the matter.The burden on the victims is about 500,000,000 yen, and the attorney court should consider the social impact in the future and bring the case to the Ooka trial.",1,1
"Damages are just a request to compensate for the damage suffered, not a punishment or sanction. For example, if property is stolen, it's like saying, ""Please return it,"" or if it's broken, it's like saying, ""Please fix it at your expense. I wonder if many people are confusing that part.(Is there such a thing as ""10 million yen was stolen, and now it's gone because you spent it, and it's too hard to return it, so let's reduce it to 1 million yen?)",1,1
"How many tens of thousands of employees do you think there are in Sushiro's business relationships alone? I am surprised that there are people who can say that they feel sorry for the perpetrators when there is a great possibility that the tens of thousands of employees will be adversely affected if the company goes under, and some of them will face a sad end as their lives are destroyed.",1,1
"To pay back the money he will work at Sushiro, learn the hard way about the restaurant business, and rise through the ranks to become a full-fledged manager. At that time, he will reflect on what he did from the bottom of his heart.",1,1
"That's because lawyers want to lower the damages to the bone.Generally speaking, the attorney's fee is determined by the starting fee and the amount of compensation that can be lowered by entering the case as an attorney.If the case is concluded with 5 million in damages, the lawyer will say, ""I lowered the amount of damages from 67 million to 62 million, and if I did nothing, I would have gotten 62 million. If we had done nothing, it would have been 67 million, but you got 62 million as a result, didn't you? The amount of attorney's fees should be calculated as a percentage from theSo, they will argue in that way to get the amount of damages claimed reduced.",1,1
"As I've written in other comments, I think it's natural and inevitable for a lawyer to come up with questionable arguments for the benefit of his client. But it sounds to me like the attorney's argument is just an all or nothing argument, saying that it's zero because it's not 100. The decline in sales may be due in part to competition, but it is also due in no small part to Sushipero, and the claim that the decline in sales is due to subjective factors of consumers in terms of hygiene is nothing more than a shifting of the causative act. It is just a substitution of the causal act.I hope that the court will not be swayed by this ridiculous logic, but I do hope that the court will make a strict decision. And as a side note, I don't want to see any sentence reduced or commuted due to extenuating circumstances. It is only natural for him to feel remorse for what he did, and the fact that he dropped out of high school was not out of his own will, but rather because he had to do so.",1,1
"Wouldn't the damages for replacing all the bottles be disallowed in a court of law? It is what Sushiro is doing to restore customer confidence, not the damages inflicted by the Sushipero boys.",1,1
It angers me that he doesn't realize that he has done something that has forced him to drop out of high school and has interfered with his peaceful life.I wonder if neither the boy nor his parents have the slightest idea to at least show a modest and sincere attitude of remorse.,1,1
"Well, the lawyer is defending the perpetrator, so that's an argument that could be made.However, there is no guarantee that the set of utensils will be left in the same place after the restaurant closes, or that the set of teacups will be left at the table where they were used.If all the claims of the lawyers are accepted, Japanese restaurants will collapse.For example, I sprayed water in my mouth on the table.And since I wiped the table, there was no harm done, so I'm not liable for compensation.",1,1
"Why did they switch it around, either the juvenile thinks or the lawyer thought about it and said it?Don't you see that if it's the lawyer, it's counterproductive and if it's the juvenile, he's not remorseful?It's obvious to replace everything!A restaurant has to have a clean image, but what are you talking about after doing all these dirty things?It's a natural step to take in order to regain a little bit of trust, a sense of security!Are you serious that you are disappointed in Sushiro for charging this much!How many stores do you think there are in the country and how much do you think it costs for security cameras, etc.?Are you feeling sorry enough for yourself because you dropped out of high school?Is it enough that you have been through hardships such as slander?In fact, we don't know how much it will cost in a court decision even if we charge them, so I think it is a perfectly natural response as a deterrent to prevent such foolishness.",1,1
"This would require a judicial decision.Whether the spread on social networking sites was foreseeable or not.I think it is good that Sushiro sued.If the perpetrator is not held responsible for the spread of the incident, it could affect the very foundation of our society.",1,1
"I don't think the Sushiro riots are as big a deal as people say.It's just the netizens who are getting excited about it.Also, there's no way the average person can afford such a large amount of compensation.Some people say that 67 million is cheap, but for the average person, it's a very high amount of compensation to the point of despair.It's only natural that the weak who can't pay are protected.",1,1
"From the boy's point of view, he will pay for his own licking, but why should I pay for the others that the company replaced on their own? Besides, the media must have spread the word about this.Since it was the media that spread the word, what would the media do if they were accused of being responsible as well?",1,1
"Sushiro's sales have gone down because of the decoy ads. At least I stopped going there because of the bait-and-switch incident. I have a problem with the actions of Peropero and his son, but I find it even more unforgivable that a company that deceives customers with impunity should be so righteous.",1,1
"At any rate, there are a lot of people who think that saying ""young people have the future"" will make them look good.Critical people don't like the fact that they can't eat out in peace because of the presence of people like this.or they don't want to have to worry about such people at their workplace or at their children's workplace.I think there are a lot of people who ""think close to home"".Those who just repeat random words that sound nice are not thinking about what they are saying.",1,1
"The statement is as if he himself had destroyed his peaceful life, but rather, it is a statement that does not take into account the feelings of the person whose peaceful business was destroyed.If he were remorseful, he would not be able to give such an answer.Would you be willing to use your own family's soy sauce jug if someone you don't know licks it? Would you be willing to use your own spoon of sugar or salt if it was licked by someone you don't know? It is very natural to feel uneasy.",1,1
"Customers who come to the store where the incident occurred are likely to know that there was an incident there. However, they are not likely to know which seat the Peropero boy sat on. Inevitably, the question becomes, ""Is the bottle okay in this seat?"" And so it goes. It is only natural that they would say, ""Let's dispose of all the bottles.",1,1
"I'm really disappointed that Sushiro would charge the boy this much.""I'm really disappointed that Sushiro would go to such lengths to try to appear like a good guy.""This is definitely the ""doer"" side.Why did you replace all the bottles?This statement suggests that the lawyer is inwardly blaming his client, the juvenile, and even intends to impose social sanctions on the juvenile.Otherwise, it would be too far out of the ordinary, wouldn't it?",1,1
"Sushiro itself is a company that has caused some problems, but they are the victim in this case. If they are going to fight in court, I hope they will deliberate on that.",1,1
"It is true that the perpetrator is the overwhelmingly weaker party. In order to defend him, then, you will have to defend his social position and economic deprivation, not his pleadings.Therefore, the organization that defends him should first announce that it will pay the full amount of the compensation on his behalf.Then we will talk.",1,1
"I think the perpetrator should be sanctioned to some extent, but regardless of that, when I see how the netizens such as twitter are desperately trying to identify and expose him, I feel that he has fallen as far as he can fall. Considering this point, the netizens are attacking the perpetrators too much. Slander is out, even against the perpetrator.",1,1
"＞High school expulsion"" and ""disruption of a peaceful life"".What does that have to do with Sushiro's damage?If there is a causal relationship, it's because of the flames caused by the spread of the video, so isn't it the result of your own actions? You didn't quit because you were sued for damages, so what is the timeline in your lawyer's mind?You claim that it is an overreaction to respond to Sushiro's reputational problems because of the ""subjective psychology of consumers,"" but this is much more a causal relationship with the video than the expulsion of the perpetrator from high school, isn't it? The ""reason for discarding all bottles of soy sauce""? It's pretty obvious, no matter how much they've loosened up, they still hadn't reached the 5th category of Corona at that time, right? It was spring, when we could finally take off our masks, right? Have you forgotten already? Are you bird-headed?You can't expect the video to go viral, and you'd be crazy to believe that someone else's video can't go viral.Have you ever seen the news? It's like that.",1,1
"I don't understand why people criticize Sushiro.This is still a reasonable price.The fact that he can't lead a peaceful life or that he quit high school is his own fault and has nothing to do with Sushiro. I think he did it because he wanted to get attention. That's good for you. You got so much attention that you can't lead a peaceful life.Besides, it's reasonable to replace the bottle. They are the ones who do such things. They may have been doing it to the other people sitting at the table, too, even if they weren't caught on video. There may be no proof that he didn't do it or that he was doing it. If that's the case, it's appropriate to replace all the bottles for the safety of the customers.",1,1
"Can't the shareholders claim damages? I thought there was a stock price drop and other damages. I haven't been to Kaiten Sushi since then. I don't know what they did to me. I don't think anything can be forgiven as long as you are remorseful. The lawyers for the defendants in cases like this that have a huge social impact should disclose their real names and the names of their firms to the public. If they are acquitted and the negative effects remain in the society, how they feel responsible for it and how they are working to eliminate the negative effects, I think it would be a good opportunity to think a little more about whether it is right to just acquit the accused in the best interest of the accused.",1,1
"The decrease in sales will directly affect employee salaries. Especially for full-time employees, bonuses will surely decrease. How will the boy and his parents feel about that? Damage to the company is just a different level, but the problem has certainly made many people's lives poorer. It's not a matter of apologizing, and it's not about 67 million yen.",1,1
"Refutation...I think it would be a good idea to review the reasons for this situation.Where did it all start...The boy may not have been entirely to blame for the drop in sales, but if the video in question was released and sales dropped significantly, the boy can't be blamed for it.",1,1
"Some people say that the compensation is too high, or that they should be made to do the dishes or something.Would you be able to say the same thing if your company was on the verge of restructuring or bankruptcy because of a child's prank that caused your sales and value to drop?If it's a small store, it's at a level where not only the management, but the employees and part-timers might lose their jobs the next day.Even if you change just one bottle, if it's the same bottle, isn't this that bottle? It leaves a lasting impression.The only way to make it look clean is to replace all the bottles.",1,1
"It is undeniable that such acts may have been committed even before the perpetrators and similar associates uploaded the information on social networking sites.It would not be the case if the business type, including kaitenzushi, was left to the good will of consumers and if the restaurant's monitoring, risk management, and alarm bells were widely publicized.When the possibility of this happening in the shadows is foreseen, it is hard to believe that the same atmosphere as before will lead to a constant and increasing number of customers coming to the store.It's like touching Pandora's box.",1,1
"If the benefits to society from the rehabilitation of this boy are balanced by the damage Sushiro has suffered from this incident, then there may be a way to defend him, but I doubt that a child who does something insane will become a decent adult.",1,1
"In fact, I myself have drastically reduced my visits to conveyor-belt sushi restaurants since the news report.I don't think there is no way that this will not have an impact.If a similar lawsuit were to occur overseas, it would probably be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. I think this amount of money has been kept in check because it is in Japan.",1,1
"Oh no.After watching this video, I'm sure many shared items at conveyor-belt sushi restaurantsI'm sure you're thinking, ""What if...?""What this boy did...It's a terrible inconvenience.It's a terrible inconvenience.It's only natural!On the contrary, I don't want him to be forgiven.It's going to take time to forget about it.And ordinary consumers, too. Probably.",1,1
"If the accident was caused by a minor and carelessness, I would defend him, but an intentional incident needs to be punished well.Is it because of advocates like that that we still can only cry ourselves to sleep over cars parked on our land without permission?",1,1
"Well, from the perpetrator boy's side, aside from remorse and emotional talk, the real problem is that he cannot afford to pay 67 million yen in compensation, so he must be prepared for criticism and argue against it, or else he will be financially trapped in life.That said, there is no need for the company to take it easy on him.",1,1
"No, no, no, a bottle of soy sauce isn't always on the same seat, and after a little time you won't even know where it's been, and if you do, it's impossible to identify the bottle. You'd have to replace them all.Maybe they think they can wash and sanitize them, but that's exactly what the customers won't accept. Even if it's sterilized, a soy sauce bottle that people have licked is just too disgusting.As for not intending to share it, when you put it on the Internet, you do it because you want someone to see it, and at this point, it is clear that you intend to [share it]. If they say they didn't think it would become this big of a deal, that's just shallow on the part of the perpetrator.Regardless of the amount of damages, etc., those who are rehabilitated will be rehabilitated, and those who are not will not be. When there is no trust or confidence, you shouldn't be talking about reducing the amount for rehabilitation.If the victim side says they will reduce the amount after the verdict, that's not something you should say at this stage.",1,1
"It's not just Sushiro's problem anymore.Other conveyor-belt sushi restaurants have been forced to take action, and even Coco Ichi has stopped putting fukujinzuke on their sushi.Sushiro cannot afford to be lax in its response.If this were an individual restaurant and not a national chain Sushiro, they would go out of business.",1,1
"The goal is to fry and confuse the focus of the discussion. What the perpetrator can do is invalidate and trivialize the discussion while pushing a heavy box.What a pain in the ass. Everywhere.I think it would be good if we respond firmly. However, Japan is lenient to juveniles and perpetrators. Compensation for damages is also small. It's hard to deal with them, isn't it?",1,1
"It is not a matter of just replacing the bottle. Whether it was a child or an adult who did it, he or she caused a lot of trouble, loss, and damage to the company and other customers, and was expelled from high school? Expulsion from high school? A hefty compensation claim? That's what he did. It can't be just a child's act, can it? It can't be justified. I don't understand the nerve of those who defend the perpetrators, and the fact that the perpetrators complain about it is proof that they don't think what they did was wrong!",1,1
"Why did you replace everything ➝ to restore credibility?The decline in sales is also due to competition; who would want to go to a store that is in such a mess? If there is another store, they would go there.Sushiro happened to be a large company, so it escaped bankruptcy. If it were a small company, it would probably go bankrupt.You should take responsibility for what you did! I think.",1,1
"I'm pissed off that the stock price dropped so low that I was forced to cut my losses and not a single word of apology from the perpetrator boy!I lost about a million dollars! Can't I claim compensation for the loss from the assailant?What about the perpetrator's lawyer?How about relief for the assailant, but not for the victim?",1,1
"Remorse is meaningless.What is needed is compensation.It doesn't matter what your intentions were in uploading the video, it went viral and you had to deal with the consequences.So it's only natural that we should compensate them.Not the kind of compensation you can afford, but 10 billion yen.Even if they don't upload the video, they should be made to understand what happens to people who do this kind of thing!Don't think you are allowed to do anything just because you are a customer!",1,1
"You have been given a discount of 67 million, an amount that your family can pay if you work together, so do your best to pay it.That is the only way you and your family can be saved.If you argue with them here, they will see that you are not sorry for the rest of your life, and you will lose your life, won't you? I think that would be more of a loss.",1,1
"Punishing the boy and restoring the restaurant's credibility are two different dimensions.It can't be helped that Sushiro is suing the boy.The boy's side should give up and write a memoir about this incident. Surprisingly, people would like to know what happens when a company is sued.If he gets some money from it, he should go study abroad.",1,1
"The time when people overlook the fact that they are children is over, isn't it?If you do that, there will be people who will take advantage of it and do what they want without restraint, so it's better to make sure they pay for what they have done.It is very easy if you don't do such things on purpose.",1,1
"If this were the Showa era...The store owner would have found out about the prank, lectured me, and called my parents to apologize for washing all the soy sauce jugs and teacups as a punishment.It might have been over.But now, with the development of social networking sites, a little video spreads like wildfire... and it's hard to keep track.No matter how much he apologizes, it won't be conveyed to the people who saw the SNS, and it won't be conveyed to the stock market either.Unfortunately, the brains of the lawyers and those who defend the boy want a Showa-esque solution.The boy's dropping out of high school and his inability to lead a peaceful life is due to his own actions.They talk as if Sushiro is responsible.The reason for replacing the soy sauce jug is because they don't know which soy sauce jug the customer nuzzled, and that's what the company is supposed to do, right?For example, let's say you're at a Chinese restaurant and you're eating fried rice and there's a hair in the rice.You ask the manager, ""What are you going to do about the hair in my fried rice?""If the manager took the hair out and said, ""This will be fine,"" would you eat the fried rice as it was?You would eat it at home.",1,1
"As long as the video is taken and the data is left behind,It is only natural to assume that the data will be leaked and spread on the Internet.It can't be said that we didn't know about it.Normal people would get scared and delete the data,They would never do something stupid and annoying in the first place.",1,1
"Frankly speaking, I think it would be better for the boy's side to put forward that he is sorry for what he did, so that the damage will be less severe, not only in the trial but also in the aftermath.",1,1
"He seems to be saying that he has been sanctioned.He may have received sanctions, but they were deserved because of what he caused.Even if he received a reasonable sanction, he would have to pay for the damage next time.That is also a matter of course.",1,1
"If you posted it on social media, you know it's going to spread and you deserve it, right?It's only natural to claim damages.Regardless of Sushiro, if there is such an act, other companies should also be able to claim damages.",1,1
"Since Sushiro has nothing to do with the spread of the video, the only thing the boy can do about it is to sue the idiot who uploaded the video.If the boy's side can do something about it, they can sue the idiot who uploaded the video.",1,1
"I think you should first admit the fact that you committed a nuisance that could have resulted in a 67 million yen bill. If the student is expelled from high school or his peaceful life is disturbed, it means that he has committed such a big problem in society, not that the store has committed some kind of act. I don't think it makes sense to try to appeal to society by shifting the issue, Mr. Lawyer.",1,1
"I worked at Sushiro and even before the Peropero fiasco, sales were down considerably due to decoys and price increases.At the beginning of Corona, they were not as aggressive as their competitors in covering sushi and installing panels in the lanes.I feel that we should put those areas on the shelf.Also, power harassment by employees was silenced no matter how many times I complained to the head office.I am not amused by Sushiro, which is ignorant of inconvenient matters and only pretends to have a sense of justice when it comes to such matters.I am not defending the boy, but I think so as someone who was there.",1,1
"&gt;&gt;On the other hand, he also states that he had no ""intention"" to share this ""nuisance"" with many people via the Internet and that he ""did not anticipate its spread"". The spreading of the message was done by a well-known influencer, which was not the boy's intention.If it hadn't been spread, the customers would have used the soy sauce bottle without knowing about it.From the customer's point of view, it is a good thing that it was spread.",1,1
"Needless to say, Sushiro's credibility has been undermined, but if it were me, I'd be too scared to walk down the street at night for the rest of my life because I've caused 16 billion yen in damage to some people in the world (who own Sushiro stock)...You don't know who's grudge you're dealing with, and the perpetrator's personal information is being exposed one way or the other.",1,1
"Malicious social networking sites and YouTubers should be thoroughly sanctioned. Regulating only the TV industry is not a healthy world. If it is a bad influence on young people, then regulation is inevitable.",1,1
"Compensation in Japan is too low. Even weekly newspapers have had so many lawsuits and lost, but they have not gone out of business. Japan must be a country that is kind to perpetrators. If they were truly remorseful, even Sushiro might not have really filed a claim even if they won in court, but there is no backing down here. I hope they go all the way. If the lawyer's argument goes through, Japan is a criminal paradise.",1,1
"It's not that he deserves it, but it's not like he's reopening himself up and doing flame distributor-type things. I do sympathize with him when I hear that he has quit school and is confined to the house.However, compensation to the victim is a different story.I don't want to beat him up even more as an outsider, but it is absurd to say that the victim should just cry himself to sleep and put up with it as long as he is remorseful.The only way to settle the matter is for both sides to argue their respective positions in court and decide where to settle the matter.",1,1
"This incident caused me to switch from being a ""family Sushiro"" all this time to another company. I like Sushiro. But the place I switched to is so good that I may never go back..................................for now.I don't think there could be others like me.",1,1
"It's obvious that he doesn't understand the gravity of what he has done, and of course, he doesn't feel sorry for what he has done!I think Sushiro should be charged for the possible damage, including the reputational damage, without any restraint, as well as for the compensation...",1,1
"Certainly, if you look at Sushiro's sushi today, it is not worth going there. It's just a slice of fish and a thumb-sized portion of sushi rice. If the price goes up to over 100 yen for a dish that looks like a plaything, I'm not going to go there.Still, the boy who stopped the rotation is diabolical.",1,1
">Furthermore, the juvenile stated in his defense that he was forced to ""drop out of high school"" and suffered ""disruption of his peaceful life,"" as stated at the beginning of this article.Would you say this to the victim? You didn't have to expel him from school. The victim did not ask to be expelled. You did the spreading of the video yourself, didn't you? That was the cause of the disturbance to her peaceful life, so it is extremely rude to ask her to cry herself to sleep because she is suffering after having strangled herself on her own.",1,1
"Why did they replace all the bottles?"" ""The decline in sales was due in part to competition.""I'm sure the lawyers are leading you on, but it's hard to look at it from the outside.It really is.I don't know what's the point of fighting in this way...Well, I guess it is necessary to clarify the facts, but I don't think the perpetrator should go beyond the limit of what he says to the victim.......",1,1
"It doesn't matter if they have been socially sanctioned or not, the damage has been done and they deserve to be compensated.If a lenient verdict is given, similar crimes will be rampant in the future.",1,1
"The boy's side is right. The structural risk of the conveyor-belt sushi restaurant has been made clear, the cost of dealing with it is enormous, and the existence of the risk was not caused by the boy's mischief, but only by his exposure. The cost is not borne by the boy.",1,1
"Why do so many articles bring emotionalism into civil trials?Unlike criminal trials, there are no extenuating circumstances.All they do is make a decision on what is a reasonable amount of money for the damages, so it's natural for both sides to make their arguments.Both sides have damages, so lower the compensation.I don't give a shit, I've already suffered damages from your actions, so pay up!Then, Your Honor, please determine the facts and decide the amount based on the evidence.This is what I'm talking about, but I wonder if everyone understands.What's the point of the reporters stirring things up for no reason?The court will only decide the verdict based on the facts, no matter how emotional the people around you are.Too many people are mixing up criminal and civil cases.",1,1
"""I didn't expect it to spread,"" in other words, if it hadn't been exposed, none of this would have happened, and the only reason it did was because it did.And the high school dropout wasn't forced, it was the result of the perpetrator's own actions.""Days of reflection""? ""It was too much for the company to change all the bottles""? So, no damages. That proves that lawyers only have this level of common sense.It's easy for you to say you're sorry, even an elementary school kid can understand that the company was put in a situation where they had no choice but to change the bottles to allay the concerns of the customers.But a lawyer who submits a defense in which he blames others for the current situation, even if it is for the sake of defense, lacks common sense.Depending on the verdict, it could be taken as if it's okay to do this kind of nuisance in a restaurant as long as you don't get caught.If they can get away with cheap damages, there will be a lot more nuisances like this in the future.",1,1
"The spread was done by a well-known influencer, and the spread was not the boy's intention: ・・・・・Then you can take the influencer to court against him.The spreading of the message spread throughout society and forced him to be expelled from school, not the Sushiro site expelling him.Don't get me wrong, you can go to court against the influencer and do whatever you want.",1,1
"I understand the intention and wisdom of the lawyers who hired them, but I think they added fuel to the fire.I think there should have been a better way to handle the case, although it is important to try to reduce the amount of the claim.This seems to increase the amount of money.",1,1
"I'm a restaurant owner, and when something like this is done, it's hard for the headquarters to lose sales, but the front line is more stunned than angry, and it's mental.I think it would be better to settle the matter clearly for the sake of all restaurants in the future.",1,1
"He says he has received social sanctions, but is it balanced against the damage? I think the 67 million yen in compensation is a low estimate, and the boy has not been redeemed at all.",1,1
"A small price considering the decline in stock prices.That's why we're doing this in the first place.Why did you... replace it?""The decline in sales is...""You're changing the subject too much.Let's say you raise the white flag on this,Then I'd be tempted to charge you for the drop in stock price and the cost of the countermeasures.I'd be tempted to charge them for the drop in stock price and all the expenses incurred to deal with it.Otherwise, there will be no end to stupid acts.",1,1
"This boy is not remorseful at all.The fact that he voluntarily dropped out of high school and stayed home is not remorse, it is just running away.If he is truly remorseful, he should ask the store where he caused trouble to let him work.Work hard at that store and reimburse them little by little. Your bosses and co-workers will probably give you the cold shoulder and won't even talk to you.But no one will think you're sorry if you're sitting at home with your parents protecting you.",1,1
"It's not like the old days: with the development of social networking sites, the damage to the company is enormous. The amount of the claim is reasonable enough. If you care about rehabilitation, you should quickly fix the judgment at this amount and move on.If you don't agree, is the guy who was filming innocent? I think he is just as guilty.",1,1
"That's how hard it is to do.As long as there are those who still do it, they should be severely sanctioned. And, as they continue to be exposed, they will be greatly regretted.And don't forget to take measures to deal with the fact that there are too many people who cannot draw a line in the sand.",1,1
"I still think they should have filed a claim for punitive damages like in the U.S.Not whether they could actually get it or not, but to make them understand the magnitude of the impact, maybe claim for the plummeting stock prices as well?",1,1
"Until now...The guy who broke the ""would be"" rule that no one would do it even if it was possible proved it to himself.Besides, to reassure the customers, ""How far do you have to go? is not something to be decided by the perpetrator who did it for fun at least, but by the store that deals with various customers, and the customers will judge it based on that.If the assailant is going to compensate for the lack of customers who still feel uneasy, I personally don't agree with irresponsibly calling it ""too much"".The reason he dropped out of school was not because Sushiro asked him to, but because he couldn't stand to be there anymore, right? I don't think it's a good idea to call the school, so you can fight about that separately, but I don't think it's something you should say to Sushiro. I don't think it's something to say to Sushiro. But the perpetrator says it was the influencer who made a big deal out of it, right? It wasn't Sushiro that made it go viral, was it? If that's the case, you can tell the influencer that you dropped out of school.",1,1
"People misunderstand that Sushiro and its style (including ""Viking"") have caused some people to become afraid of it, and if that happens, whether it is Sushiro or Kura Sushi, the entire industry could collapse, so Sushiro cannot stop claiming for damages, However, the media has started to respond to this with such absurd answers as ""too much"" and ""let the victim work there"". It's scary to lose sight of something as simple as ""Why should the victim hire the perpetrator?",1,1
"After all this.I think 67 million yen is quite too cheap.On the contrary, I think we should be grateful to SushiroI think it is an amount of money.If the assailant perused the bottle.That's not nice, so from the company's point of view.I'll change them all to new bottles.The assailant should pay up quickly.",1,1
"The social sanction this child received and Sushiro's claim for compensation for the damage he suffered are two completely different things.For example, if she injured someone, there is no way she can claim that she has been socially sanctioned enough to pay for her medical treatment and that she should pay for it out of her own pocket.",1,1
"Social sanctions and punishment would be different.I think it is a slippery slope to say that after a person has atoned for his/her crime, he/she should not be prevented from rehabilitation because of social sanctions.",1,1
"The social sanctions that the culprits say they have received enough are ultimately transitory,The damage to Sushiro's side is clearly tangible, including costs and reputational damage.There doesn't seem to be a single factor that would prolong the situation.",1,1
">Damages that were never possible in this countryThe first thing that made me laugh was the change in tone of Hino Momogusa-kun from last week.I wonder if he has studied the reality of civil lawsuits a little.＞I would also like to say from the author that it is the judiciary that judges, not ""Sushiro"" ""punishing"", and not Sushiro. This is exactly the misunderstanding of other punishment.Your last article made it sound like you didn't even understand the difference between criminal and civil cases.Actually, are you watching here, Hino, it's important to study WW.",1,1
"It seems to be a kind of ""other side's"" viewpoint on the whole affair, but isn't it natural that the public is all in favor of the restaurant? I'm sure that people like Mr. Hino Nanigashi, who wrote this and makes his living writing such things and eating sushi that doesn't turn, would never be a victim of the soy sauce spooning...most of the world could be a victim of this kind of thing. Don't you understand that that's why there are so many people who want to see this kind of thing severely punished?",1,1
"In fact, after this incident, we held a one-day training course for all store managers to ensure thorough hygiene management. If they come out with a ""what the heck"", there will be huge bills waiting for them, such as labor cost/day for each manager, travel expenses, labor cost for store employees for the manager who left, training venue cost, instructor cost, etc... ......I feel like we should settle this as soon as possible, lol.",1,1
"I'm protected by juvenile law, and I've seen articles about the course of that trial.I would like to see an article on what happened in the subsequent civil suit for damages. To keep the case itself from fading away...",1,1
"The ""juvenile has been sufficiently socially sanctioned"" is a request for extenuating circumstances because he has been socially sanctioned in the ""criminal"" context, but it has nothing to do with the ""civil"" context of compensation for damages, does it not?",1,1
"If there had been no social networking and it had been confined to that store, it would have only been a single slap on the wrist, but the video spread all over the world.In fact, more than 10 billion dollars were lost.",1,1
"The store is within its rights to claim all economic damages.The judiciary can decide what to do.Those of you with the ""too harsh"" opinion, aren't you the complete ""customer-oriented"" ones?Like ""the driver is eating curry,"" or if a child drops a loaf of bread sold in the store, they don't need to buy it up.",1,1
"Sushiro's response is correct!They should take responsibility for what they did for whatever reason.It may ruin one boy's life as an example.But there is no end to the number of minors who get carried away, so I guess it can't be helped.",1,1
"This is what a trial is like!Even the defendant's side of the story has a lawyer.The victim wants maximum punishment and the perpetrator wants a reduced sentence.I know only from news reports, but I have nothing to say! No defendant said maximum punishment. All have reduced sentences. Some of them plead not guilty even in cases where everyone thinks they are absolutely guilty. Lawyers are also not guilty, and this lawyer is crazy, isn't he? There are cases like that, aren't there? Isn't the case of Sushiro also quite normal? Everyone is always looking out for themselves! Everyone does.",1,1
"I think Kaitenju was originally built to prevent such things from happening. I think the restaurant needs to evolve more and more.In the old days, I would have been very angry with them and that would have been the end of it.I would never go to a restaurant like that.It's a difficult time to live in, even though the times are changing.",1,1
"If you're going to be that resistant to corporations, I hope you get sued by a lot of people who were made uneasy or sickened by that video about eating out.I think they should be sued by a lot of people.I guess they don't appreciate the response of the companies to eliminate such concerns.",1,1
"There is only deterrence. Before this boy, there were countless, up and coming, part-time terrorist attacks and countless others.I heard that some restaurants went out of business.I feel that Sushiro's decision was appropriate and even representative of the restaurants that were hit.",1,1
It might be a good idea to claim all damages and countermeasure expenses without any restraint and let the court make a decision.,1,1
"I know it's their job, but these lawyers for the offending party are offensive.Besides, if these lawyers were told when they enter a restaurant and use dressing or condiments that they have slurped down one of the condiments in the restaurant, would they be able to eat there comfortably?I mean, replacing all the bottles isn't excessive.",1,1
"If you're going to bring up the temporary drop in the stock price, how do you explain the subsequent spike?You can't prove that the video caused the drop, nor can you prove why it rose above its original price, let alone recovered.",1,1
"I find the compensation to be small.He said he didn't intend for the video to go viral.That's a lie when you put it up on social media.This time, it's only substantial compensation for the equipment. I think that's very kind.Considering the decrease in corporate value, stock price, etc., I think the amount of compensation should be higher.",1,1
"The perpetrator's lawyer is probably just quibbling to reduce the amount of compensation.The school was not forced to expel him, but he left voluntarily, and the days of remorse and the like have nothing to do with the damages.In the end, it's not about the law, it's just about making the public feel sorry for the perpetrator to reduce the amount of compensation.That is not the same thing.",1,1
"Sushiro is not bad.If they do something halfway here, I think the same thing will happen again.I think they should pay for the damages, if not the full amount.",1,1
"My interpretation is that the reason he apologized with tearful eyes and went to Sushiro to apologize was because he wanted to ""let bygones be bygones and not claim compensation,"" and that he has no intention of showing remorse at all.Since he offered his own neck, saying, ""There is no need for extenuating circumstances,"" please go ahead and do it to your heart's content.If you and your children work hard, you can pay off this amount of money in 10 years.You have enough time left to start your life over.",1,1
"He says he is sorry, but I guess the boy thinks it was just a small prank. What he did is a respectable criminal act, so he should be imprisoned if he is not protected by the Juvenile Law, and I hope he will think carefully about how much damage his act caused to Sushiro's side and atone for his crime. If the spreading of the video was unexpected, why not sue the person who spread it, instead of asking Sushiro to reduce the sentence? It might get bogged down in the mud... lol",1,1
"I don't see any remorse on the part of the perpetrators...Is that the end of it because you stopped the school?　⇒No, no, no, that's not remorse.I stopped going to Kaitenzushi after that incident.The soy sauce bottle is not always in that position from the beginning to the end, so they may replace it.It's not only the sales decrease, but also the restaurant's credibility would be ruined if they showed that kind of thing.",1,1
"The amount of compensation was ¥67 million to about ¥93 million.The company's compensation is still within the ""just barely compensable"" range.The future of the trial remains to be seen.The boy's side (which is probably beyond his control) is still ready to fight the case.The boy's side is still ready to fight the case.""There was no need to replace all the bottles.Or, taking advantage of the difficulty of proving the damage?""We did not anticipate the proliferation.""The decline in sales was due in part to competition.""Rumor damage is subjective to the consumer,"" etc., etc.In addition, he himself has been accused of being the one to blame.He also states that he himself has been ""expelled from high school"" and ""prevented from leading a peaceful life.Rather than showing remorse, he seems to want to somehow lessen the blame...(trouble).",1,1
"I'm sorry."" - ""Of course I'm sorry.Why did you wash everything?"" - It's a natural thing to do because otherwise you won't get the customer's trust back.The influencer is the one who spread the news."" - If he had just eaten sushi normally, there would have been no way to spread the news.He dropped out of high school. - Did Sushiro tell him to quit? That has nothing to do with it.I think it's a legal layman's opinion.But the Japanese judiciary is so out of touch.Maybe the victim will have to put up with the perpetrator's ""chance for rehabilitation"".",1,1
"In fact, I have not been to Sushiro since that incident. It will take some time for the memory to fade, but I can imagine that the 67 million yen was a light estimate and the damage must have been much more than that.He has no choice but to make sincere amends for what he has done. It may be a way to negotiate a settlement, but the rebuttal is unimpressive.",1,1
"The amount of 6,700 yen is very low, and I think Sushiro's side must have been very merciful to the boy.",1,1
"I wonder if you have thought about the risk of being thought of as a great reopener?The lawyer, if asked, would have no choice but to say that Black is also clear, but it might be more beneficial to say that it is clear, so what should we do? You can make a suggestion, can't you?As you can imagine, Doraemon will not come out and say, ""I told you to do it, so I'm not guilty! I don't think he would say ""Not guilty because I told him to do it!",1,1
"So, to summarize, you're saying, ""He's just a kid, so forgive him.""?A crime is a crime. The fact that I did it can't be erased, and the person who took the pictures is just as guilty, but it's impossible to say that I didn't think it wouldn't spread.The fact that the video was posted on the Internet means that there is a non-zero chance that it will be spread, so there is no excuse.If the video is only for your friends, you should put it somewhere where it can only be seen by the dedicated commuters.",1,1
"I used to like Sushiro and go there frequently, but I haven't been there since this incident. So there must be many people in the same situation as me, and the amount of damage is immeasurable. Please accept that you have done something that big. I don't want to see you argue with me.",1,1
"An example needs to be made to prevent further damage.The boy should be the first one to be made an example of, to limit the second and third damage.(though it's already happened)Besides, he deserves to be judged as long as actual damage is done.I don't think he has enough remorse for what he did.",1,1
"What's wrong with the defenders actually suing Sushiro for the amount they think is the damage?Whether or not that amount would be accepted in court is another matter. Of course they're going to try to maximize the amount of compensation. The bigger the amount, the more the court costs will increase, so Sushiro is not just playing around.",1,1
"I can't keep my mouth open.You are suffering ""damage"" that prevents you from living a peaceful life because of the noise?If this is the extent of your ""remorse,"" then you should charge them the true amount of damage without hesitation.They probably don't even know the value of intangibles such as safety and branding.I think you still mistakenly believe that what you are being pursued for is ""for show"" in your true heart.",1,1
"I used to love Sushiro, but I haven't been going to Sushiro since Peropero. I don't feel like going to Sushiro, but I don't feel like going to conveyor belt sushi. There is such a person here in fact. Well, I guess the lawyers are just saying that they have to defend something, or at least that's all they can say.",1,1
"There is no room for the perpetrators to argue if they think about why they got into trouble in the first place.If they want to argue, they should say that it didn't say not to put your mouth on the bottle.",1,1
"As for the psychology of the user,""I wonder if the bottle on my seat was also licked.""The result is that customers leave and the company suffers a major blow.As a result, the company will suffer a major blow.That is why we have replaced all bottles in all our stores.So I want you to use our restaurants with peace of mind.↑↑Can't the lawyer for the perpetrator understand this kind of logic?",1,1
"The perpetrator is only pretending to be sorry, but in the end he is not sorry at all. The amount of claims should be increased. I am not saying that the human rights of the perpetrators are unnecessary, but it is natural that relief for the victims should be given priority.",1,1
"You say this and that, but the direct cost of the measures alone is substantial.Rather, I think that 67 million yen for this boy's act is quite warm-hearted.",1,1
"This is because the people who were once so enthusiastic about destroying towns, stores, and public transportation have somehow come to admire the truth and justice, and those who have been entrusted to take their place are remembering the past and intending to lighten the sentence as much as possible.",1,1
"I'm sorry for the boy, but he's been socially sanctioned enough, and I'm not going to be angry any more, so please pay him the damages.I'm sorry for the boy, but I'm not going to be angry any more because he's been socially sanctioned enough.",1,1
"I think the media is also going too far in trying to incite the juvenile by reporting allegations that are apparently the input of his lawyer as if they were conceived by the juvenile, and creating a vicious characterization of him. This is not a defense, I just don't want to see the punishment lightened by being recognized as socially sanctioned as a result of the inflammatory nature of this stunt.",1,1
"I'm really disappointed that Sushiro would charge the boy this much money, and I'm surprised that anyone would comment that Sushiro would go to such lengths and try to look like a good guy.I'm surprised that there are people who make comments like that, and Sushiro just did what they had to do.If customers leave, some people will lose their jobs, and if they don't take thorough measures, they won't come back.They must be spending a lot more money than they charged the boy for that.A small business would go out of business.If you are disappointed, even if the same thing happens to the company you work for, can you say, ""It's a boy, you know? Can you say, ""Gasp! You could lose your job.It is a natural response to make them compensate for the damage they have suffered, not to put on a good person's face.You're going to accept the damage to your company's image and do nothing about it? You will lose your job and that's the end of it.I think you are lucky that you only had to pay this much compensation to a major company.",1,1
"Of course they replaced it because they might have licked something other than what was on the video.There is no guarantee that only the items in the video were tampered with, so the store would have to replace all of them because it would be a matter of trust.",1,1
"It's not a rebuttal thought up by a juvenile with no ability to think, it's probably a rebuttal thought up by a lawyer. I don't think a lawyer hired by an average person is very good, but please, I hope Sushiro's side hires a good lawyer and doesn't end up losing the case.",1,1
"Where is the advocacy?From what I've seen and heard, there are no defenders.Expulsion from high school is something the boy did on his own, right?Did Sushiro ask him to do that? I've never heard of that.In the first place, the bite terror and the scumbag terrorBut he did it because he dared.I think they underestimated the compensation.I think we should be thorough at this point.",1,1
"I don't understand the point of claiming 67 million yen in damages for a prank that was done as a prank.Even if a decision is made to award 67 million yen in damages, it does not mean that the 600 Sushiro restaurants nationwide will be safe and secure.In the first place, there is a flaw in the system in which sushi is frequently passed in front of customers without the store being able to see or control it.Mr. Naughty Peropero-kun has neither the intention nor the imagination to cause a decline in sales at 600 restaurants nationwide.He will probably end up with a compensation order of a few tens of thousands of yen at most.",1,1
"I have no sympathy for the boy, we need stiffer penalties.These crimes have been reported in other countries, so we need to be very strict to prevent copycats.",1,1
">Furthermore, the juvenile stated in his defense that he was forced to ""drop out of high school"" and suffered ""disruption of his peaceful life,"" as stated at the beginning of this article.The high school expulsion was his own decision, the disruption of his peaceful life was caused by his own actions, and this doesn't remedy Sushiro's harm, does it?The answer, which is supposed to be written by your lawyer, is not logical at all.If it was negligence, it would still be debatable, but what are you talking about with an intentional act that you did?",1,1
It would be safer for the other customers if they replaced all the bottles.It's a tough job for lawyers to have to defend for money even when they know the perpetrator is clearly in the wrong.,1,1
"No, no. You should study before you write articles."" I felt like daring to say coercively. The court only recognizes the loss of profit that should have been gained as the amount of damages. If they make an ethical decision as to whether sanctions are necessary or not, I am more afraid of that judicial system. That side of the story is in the criminal court.",1,1
Can't you at least understand that it was only because we showed that we had thoroughly improved the situation that we were able to contain so much damage?Who is going to be satisfied with the fact that we destroyed that one bottle?I don't think the perpetrator has the right to say a lot of things.,1,1
"Well, it's certainly a prank that I'm not sure about, but if you're asking me if it's 67 million iniquities, I'm not so sure.I'll have to look at the basis of the calculation to see how reasonable it is...Of course, it is appropriate for the company to take firm action, and I think they are prepared to sue, but it will be interesting to see how the case actually lands.",1,1
"Sushiro is the worst for bait ads, bad taste, higher prices, but only for this case.I support Sushiro. (Not that I go to Sushiro, but...)However, I'm not just this lawyer, but I'm wondering how you can be on the offending party's side and come up with such a defense.I wonder how they can come up with such an answer that offends the feelings of the other party, even though they are the aggressor.They should be made to pay the full amount.",1,1
"When you say ""juvenile's side,"" some people will misunderstand you as if you or the father were saying that.Lawyers will do anything to protect their client's interests, including shifting the point of contention and skirting the holes in the law.",1,1
"It's not Sushiro's fault.Even if there was no intention of spreading the word, other idiots might have done it too, so thank you for replacing all the bottles.That high school student made Sushiro into a sushi restaurant that can't spin sushi, and he doesn't seem to be sorry at all.They don't turn, so you have to order everything, and when they get a few more customers, the tablet terminal just keeps asking them to wait a while.It's very stressful.If you're going to complain, don't do it in the first place.",1,1
"Preventing recurrence is important.Punishment must be meted out properly as an example to prevent others of the same kind from coming out.In the case of accidents involving children playing on playground equipment, a large amount of compensation should be demanded to prevent recurrence.If the amount is small or if the children cry themselves to sleep, the same problem will be repeated.Evil should be banished for a better life.",1,1
"I have to admit that I find the lawyer's argument completely distressing.If ""I didn't think it would happen, but it didn't,"" is acceptable, then it is also acceptable to say that you didn't think you would cause an accident even if you had been drinking.",1,1
"Emotional arguments like ""I feel sorry for you"" and ""Suck it up"" are meaningless. It is natural to claim for damages, the court calculates a reasonable amount, and the perpetrator pays it. All you have to do is to handle the matter as a matter of course.",1,1
"You say that the decline in sales is due to competition, but isn't it you who are the factor that caused customers to go to your competitors? I think so. If a good image in commercials contributes to sales, then so does a bad image. After paying Sushiro, why don't you sue the media and say, ""Because you guys reported what I did, sales went down and I had to pay!"" Why don't you sue them?",1,1
"A rebuttal that cannot be made without acceptance by the assailant, even if it is the lawyer's idea.Accepting such a proposal means that there is no remorse after all,What was being repeated was an apology to ask for forgiveness.",1,1
"By the same logic.Why was the boy expelled?He was expelled voluntarily, not expelled from school, so there is no need to take this point into account in extenuating circumstances.",1,1
"High school dropout"" and ""disruption of peaceful life.""You are a high school student, so you must be old enough to know what is right and what is wrong.They are high school students, so they should be old enough to know what is right and what is wrong.I don't think it is out of line to say that because he dropped out of high school or that it interferes with a peaceful family life.I think the compensation should be much larger than that.",1,1
"I certainly don't understand why you are defending this boy. Did he do similar things when he was younger?After all, if an adult was with him, the adult has a duty to warn him.",1,1
"Even if they were able to reduce the amount of compensation, if they had to go to court and argue about some silly theory, the parents' apology and attitude of remorse might be seen as an act to get forgiveness without compensation. It might be thought that they are acting to get forgiveness without compensation. It's not kind of you to write an article about the trial.",1,1
"That's proof that he has no remorse. It's like saying that the reason he was expelled is because of this case, but it was because of his usual bad behavior. You are a coward, saying that what happened to you is this case, and what Sushiro suffered is other factors as well.",1,1
"If they had simply apologized, it would have been enough, but the way they tried to shift the blame for the decline in sales onto the competition and other factors seems to have touched a nerve.It is no wonder they feel no remorse.",1,1
"Essentially, only the victim should be able to say to another person, ""Give me a break, I'm still young.It is only backhandedness on the part of the perpetrator to say, ""Give me a break,"" or ""You've gone too far.For what they have done, they have to make amends by falling into error against the victim, don't they?",1,1
"The more we defend this nuisance, the more the nuisance will not go away.Of course we want the nuisance to go away, so I agree with Sushiro's response.",1,1
"forced to withdraw from high school and suffered ""disruption of his peaceful life,"" the answer states.That's the kind of seed you sow yourself, isn't it?It's not compulsory education, so it's no wonder the kid who caused this kind of problem was expelled, and it was you who destroyed his peaceful life.How can you say you didn't think it would be spread, that you don't know about all the haggling you've done? I think so.At first I thought that even if Sushiro sued him, he would eventually settle out of court, but if he goes so far in his backhanded rebuttal, he won't be able to settle out of court, will he?",1,1
"The boy's side laughs at the boldness of the discrepancy, saying, ""I didn't expect it to go viral. If it had not spread, there would not have been such an uproar, and they would have just laughed at it with their phones in hand.But that is not the point. The boy's inability to understand something that even a small child could understand is painful, or rather, his stupidity is exposed....In addition, the claim that the decrease in sales is due to competition from other stores is so stupid that one can only laugh at the stupidity of it.I think a prison sentence in jail would be best. I don't think that will actually happen.... People who don't realize the gravity of what they have done are not needed in society. I strongly believe that he deserves to stay behind bars for the rest of his life and continue to investigate the meaning of remorse.",1,1
Whose fault is it that you dropped out of high school and lost your peace of mind?I believe it cost you more than 67 million yen just for the profit and loss of your absence and the cost of countermeasures.You should reflect more on the actions you have committed.,1,1
"If it's done in private (at home, for example), it can be done among friends, but it's done with a company and even posted on a social networking site. This is the kind of thing that should be done to prevent a recurrence. It's been a while since I've been to Kura Sushi, but I was relieved to find sushi still rolling.",1,1
"Whether the competition is a factor or not can be quickly determined by comparing the year-on-year sales levels of the competitors and any campaigns they may be running.If there is no significant change in the performance of the competitors and only Sushiro's sales are down, it is due to the influence of the perpetrator.",1,1
"You were in a good mood and caused trouble, so you have to take responsibility. It's not enough to say, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry. If you really feel bad, you should apologize in person, on TV or whatever. If you want, you can stream a video of your apology. You're good at that, aren't you?",1,1
"Subjective psychology? I'm talking about the boy that's the source of it.Why replace all the bottles? The sushi pero guy might have licked all the other bottles outside the video. How do you prove he didn't do it? How do you prove he didn't swap the licked bottles with other bottles? It's the devil's proof, right? That's why you had to change all the bottles.Can't you even understand that?At any rate, what this tells us is that the boy probably has no remorse at all, and that the parents said a lot of things, but in the end it was just an argument because they didn't want to pay.I don't know what will happen at the trial, but I hope the company will fight the case thoroughly.If they don't, people will think that there is zero risk even if something happens, and the spread of the video will accelerate even more. It will no longer be a deterrent.",1,1
"No matter how much Mr. Pero claims, I don't think it's enough.I think the amount of compensation offered by Sushiro is small even at that.That amount of money is cheap considering the decrease in customers, the decrease in sales, the cost of countermeasures, the drop in stock price, etc.",1,1
"I feel this rebuttal makes a bad impression on the judge. It may be a media clipping, but it doesn't seem like sincere remorse by any stretch of the imagination. It looks like a backhanded retort, as if the school is fine with it because they expelled him too. I think the lawyer is trying to get a reduction in the amount, but normally speaking, he doesn't seem remorseful at all, does he? It's going to be like that.",1,1
"If ""the customers left is a matter of subjectivity,"" then anything goes, even spreading rumors.Sushiro should charge more for their services. Without Peropero, there would be no loss and no effort. They are completely victims. There is nothing to lose.",1,1
"Social networking sites don't appeal? Take the video and broadcast it on social networking sites. That would be a criminal act. I guess the victim's store would have to pay the actual cost, but for a chain store, the cost of advertising and the number of stores would be too high.",1,1
"The damages, in theory, are basically just the cost of the bottle of soy sauce. I don't think you can understand that. But the result is, I wonder if the court will allow a certain amount.",1,1
67 million is so cheap! That was my impression.And I would think that a contending attitude on the part of the assailant would make them want to charge additional money if they took that kind of attitude.Did I mention that the additional amount being considered is in excess of 90 million?I don't know what this assailant's family is thinking.Why didn't they just show their honest remorse instead of showing a contentious attitude?Public opinion would not be on their side.,1,1
"Why did they replace all the bottles?Of course it's because if the same bottles were used in the store where the problem occurred, it would be bad for the image.Don't you understand how important image is in the customer business?",1,1
I find it sickening that people criticize Sushiro and defend the boy.I wonder if it is even advisable to argue with a lawyer.I think it would be better for him and the public to know how much of a negative impact they have on society if they cause trouble.,1,1
"When I saw the Sushiro incident, I thought for sure someone was doing the same thing. After this video, I stopped eating conveyor belt sushi.I was reminded of the risks, not the excesses, and I hated it.",1,1
"Reading the comments, I'm amazed at how many people are asking for compensation based on emotion alone.From the boy's point of view, this is a natural response.In terms of the crime, he probably only damaged the soy sauce pot.The subsequent uproar was caused by the media and the Internet, so it is only natural for the boy's side to argue the causal relationship between that and the boy's actions.How far will the judge accept this causal relationship?Or will the Sushiro side claim compensation from the influencers and netizens who spread this?This is going to be an interesting trial!",1,1
"Regardless of the Sushiro case, those who publish their insane acts as videos on social networking sites are probably not aware that they are doing something reprehensible.Are they reflecting on their actions only because the commotion has grown so loud, and are they aware that their actions are insane?",1,1
"I think the advocacy argument is as irresponsible as it is impersonal. If you are going to play the sophomoric argument that you are not saying this in an ""irresponsible"" way, you might as well make up for some of the damage that the restaurants have suffered and then say it. I can only think that these people are just taking pleasure in their self-satisfaction by brandishing a no-nonsense ""righteousness and warmth"" because it is not something that has happened to them and will not hurt their own pockets. Because it is someone else's business, they are all about easygoing statements. This is the ultimate in irresponsibility. You should be aware of this.",1,1
"If we do it halfway and there are copycats all over the country, we won't be able to continue as a company. We can't leave something unclean.It's a matter of course. What are you talking about? What's the explanation?Tell him that if there are any copycats, you'll be charged for the damage.Fight them thoroughly. The longer it goes on, the worse it is for them. You should continue the rotten argument and show society what will happen if you do that.",1,1
"The defendant will think that it's too much to still pay a hefty reimbursement after having apologized and been expelled from school, but they just shouldn't have done such an unorthodox thing in the first place. There is no need to respond to the defendant's loudly shouting that it is not fair. Rather, as an example, the defendant should be thoroughly pursued and warned so that the next idiot will not come along.",1,1
"As for the spread, if I had to say, 'the guy who took the picture posted it so others could see it,' then 'other people's fault' would still be no surprise, but once you put it on social media, you're screwed.People are bound to use it as a story, good or bad.If you just want to enjoy watching it among your friends, you should have just taken a picture of it and showed it to them directly.It's like saying, ""Please beat me up as much as you want.Mouth is the root of all evil. Gods that don't touch you are cursed. You and your children should stay away from danger.Although these words don't directly apply to this case, don't do anything unnecessary.If you are going to speak out, speak out with the intention of, for example, not affecting the family members who were not present when this happened, or to save the restaurant or the restaurant industry as a whole from having to take extra measures....You are only thinking of yourself.Don't say unnecessary things and apologize. I'm not sorry.",1,1
"The act itself is what is being questioned, and the spreading of the video is secondary.The theory that if they had not been caught, they would not have been charged with a crime.It is a great crime to have destroyed the tacit trust in the safety of food and the trust that no one would do such a thing in the case of conveyor-belt sushi.",1,1
"I think the lawsuit by Sushiro is indeed overkill. Frankly, I'm rather afraid to go to Sushiro.Especially parents with teenage children must be horrified.　If a child does something like that, it could end the parent's life, too, right?",1,1
"No matter how clean and neat a restaurant is, there are probably more than a few people who, when reminded of this incident, drop the restaurant from their list of dining out options.That alone is enough to cause damage, isn't it?",1,1
"Are you all forgetting a vital fact?When do you think this incident happened? Before the coronas were still under the category 5 certification policy? If people like this were doing this kind of thing at such a time, there's even a risk of infection from soy sauce jugs, you know? With that in mind, it's only natural that when people like this come out, they replace all soy sauce jugs nationwide. That's what everyone is totally forgetting.",1,1
"All the bottles, why did we replace all the bottles? It's possible that Perorin did it not only at that table that day, but also at other tables on other days, right?Well, since it was an unexpected event, he must have changed the bottles because he thought someone else might have done it too.",1,1
"After a problem like that, the perpetrator deserves to have his peaceful life threatened. I think bullying and moral offenses like that are more culpable than any other crime.",1,1
"I've always kind of disliked Sushiro, but I started to dislike them when I started getting sushi pelted.The sushi is just poured out slowly, other customers take what they ordered, and if there are too many items, you can't tell which one is yours, and the system is a pain in the ass.There was even a time when the fried shrimp I ordered had long fucking hair in it.And then there was the time they made the Sushi-Pero boy the scapegoat for the bad reviews they got from the decoy ads, and that's when I stopped going because I didn't like their corporate structure anymore.I hated Sushiro, Sushiro's convenient use of the Sushi-Pero boy, the flawed restaurant system, and everything else related to Sushiro.These days, I go to another sushi restaurant that opened in my neighborhood.I've been going to another sushi restaurant that opened in my neighborhood recently because they only serve the sushi I ordered and the food comes quickly and looks clean.",1,1
It is only natural for companies to claim the damages they have incurred. Preventing recurrence is also necessary for those of us who use the restaurant as regular customers. There is no reason to defend the perpetrators.,1,1
"What does it matter if you've been socially sanctioned?You can't completely identify the bottle the dimwitted boy licked, and some people think he might have done it when it's not in the video, so the only way to show that you're clean is to replace the whole thing.",1,1
"You put it up on a social networking site.It's sophistry to say you didn't intend for it to spread.It's just that you don't seem to be able to pay.And you're resisting to avoid it at all costs.It's somewhat understandable.However, the punishment should be severe.",1,1
"It is a matter of life and death for the store. If they don't do it thoroughly, there will be others who will imitate them, and in that case, the store's business model will cease to exist. A shareholder lawsuit is also a possibility, so why are outsiders irresponsibly defending the perpetrators?",1,1
"How many articles has this person, Hino Hyakuso, written with the title ""Why defend only perpetrators""? After all, those who respond to this title and feel that he is ""defending only perpetrators"" must understand that they have been successfully caught by Hino Momokusa's title fishing.",1,1
"Well, I'm sure it was all put in by lawyers. But it's a bad move. It's not a good idea to pass the opinion of a child who knows nothing about the restaurant industry as a professional opinion, even though his job is to defend it.Even if the boy says so, shouldn't you just tell him off and try to keep the wound as light as possible? You're making the situation worse than it already is.",1,1
"You are mistaken, but this monk's current position is that of a perpetrator.It is only natural that Sushiro went this far.If he posted it on a social networking site, it is possible in this day and age that people who have negative opinions about his behavior will spread the word that there are insane people out there.I think the person who did it is the worst, but I also feel that the people around him or her who did not stop him or her are just as guilty.And to film it for fun and post it on a social networking site is insane.",1,1
"First of all, if you think about the basics, you can see how deadly a sin it is.Why did you take the video?If it was a gag between friends, it could have been done only in that store.No one would even notice.And why did he spread the video?What could have been done in one store would have gone viral, and would have ruined the store's credibility.If they wanted to charge us a billion dollars, they wouldn't be able to say anything.That's what I call brazen and shameless.",1,1
"The extent to which the juvenile's offending behavior caused the loss and the extent to which the juvenile should be held responsible for the loss are two separate issues. It would be unreasonable to assume that the cost of discarding and replacing all soy sauce bottles is the result of the juvenile's actions.There are many restaurants that take measures to prevent such nuisances, such as having an appropriate number of staff on duty and providing shoyu dispensers on a case-by-case basis, and these restaurants spend money to provide a sense of security and cleanliness to their customers.The fact that these restaurants have drastically cut such costs and offer such services at a discount price has made customers feel uneasy about the possibility of similar nuisances at any restaurant, which is a problem with the business model. If the restaurant had originally focused on safety measures, the nuisance would not have made customers feel uneasy about other restaurants as well.",1,1
"In the drama ""Kita no Kuni Kara (From the North),"" Jun comes to Tokyo and gets his girlfriend pregnant.There was a scene in which the father, Goro, goes from Furano to apologize with five pumpkins as a gift of apology. There, the father of the girlfriend, played by Bunta Sugawara, says something like ""What is sincerity?"" and Goro sells lumber and other things to make up the money.So I want to ask the boy, ""What is sincerity?"" It may be a prank, but he did something that overturned the very foundation of Japanese sushi culture called ""kaitenzushi,"" and ""I have left school"" or ""I have a peaceful life,"" don't you think he doesn't understand the gravity of the situation? Aren't you quite out of line with what you are saying about how bad it is that it was spread on the Internet?",1,1
"I still go to Sushiro, but I remember that video and scurry around, it was indeed a creepy act!I hope the judge will rule that they will never do it again!No more, no less!",1,1
"This boy is not in a position to complain about the verdict. He has caused trouble to others besides Sushiro, so his liability could be more than 100 million, and he has no choice but to repeat his apology and ask for forgiveness rather than refute it.",1,1
"If your products are not popular because they don't taste good, etc. and sales drop, why would you allow sales to drop due to rumors caused by customers you don't understand?What if you were an employee there? You might lose your own income due to poor performance.You can say that because you are a child or because you have nothing to do with it.",1,1
"What is it about words that only the perpetrator is allowed to say, but the victim or an uninvolved third party says them as if they should be said?I think the words ""I can forgive him because he is a child"" are meant to imply that even if the perpetrator said them, ""Of course you will take responsibility for him, won't you? I think it means ""Of course, your guardian will take responsibility, won't you?Just because he is a child is not a reason to reduce the sentence.",1,1
"Hmm? There are media outlets defending them? Why are they defending the perpetrators when they are just doing what is natural for a company? If we don't teach these idiots, such as those who eat directly from the soft-serve ice cream machine, what will happen to them if they do it, they will do anything to get attention. I wonder how the media and reporters who defended them will take responsibility for their actions. If they are prepared to bear even a part of the compensation, they should do it.",1,1
"No, it's not right when you don't realize you've done that much.The lawsuit should be done properly and judged properly.Consumers being the dominant force in the worldIt can only have a negative impact on the economy, including employment.",1,1
"It has been said in some circles for some time that restaurants and other customer-oriented businesses should take a ""written pledge"" from customers before they enter the restaurant.The main purpose of the written pledge is that the person who enters the restaurant assumes full responsibility for any damage caused to the restaurant.Anyone who refuses to do so will not be allowed to enter the store.If you don't like it, don't come.The store must have some kind of self-protection.",1,1
"If they can't identify which bottle it is, they'll replace all the bottles. You don't think they just leave them on the table?",1,1
"The mentality of the perpetrators who were able to present this claim, even if only through their lawyers, is amazing.It's impossible to be remorseful after shifting the responsibility for the spread and the damage to others.Am I the only one who thinks they would be more sympathetic if they just apologized in general?",1,1
"&gt; forced to ""drop out of high school"" and suffer ""disruption of peaceful life"".This is the result of his own actions and is not a reason for extenuating circumstances.It is not a reason for extenuating circumstances.If he hadn't done it in the first placeI wouldn't be in this situation if I hadn't done it in the first place.But lawyers are lawyers, aren't they?They're going to get more and more criticism.Sushiro should be considered a foreign company.Falling stock prices are an act of defiance to shareholders.If there's a cause.I'll go all the way.",1,1
"Many conveyor-belt sushi restaurants have become non-turnover sushi. Given the investment in these facilities, it is not surprising that they charge more. Lately, we have been too lenient in prying into the family environment and background of the victims, haven't we? If you do something wrong, you must pay for it.",1,1
"Rehabilitating them by making them wash dishes, clean, or bring in luggage... Then the person who made that statement should shoulder the compensation and in return, rehabilitate them by making them do some kind of labor.Or that's what parents are supposed to do.The obligation to rehabilitate? It is strange that Sushiro, the victim, is obligated to rehabilitate himself.The point of contention is wrong.",1,1
"Handling complaints, washing all hot water bottles to dispel customer anxiety, replacing soy sauce bottles, and replacing them with new ones for customers who still feel uneasy.It would be nice if all the boys in all the restaurants could handle this.Plus all the social repercussions for competitors and other restaurants.67 million?That's not even enough to cover the cost of labor to deal with the situation before sales and stock drop.What are you talking about, quitting school or life? I don't have that kind of money.I've put myself through too much money and trouble to make up for it even if I had to spend my whole life.",1,1
"Even if they end up crying themselves to sleep, it's an example.I think they are trying to warn people so that the same thing will not happen again.If the store is going to cry itself to sleep, the perpetrator needs to cry itself to sleep too.",1,1
Does this mean that the juvenile's lawyer was brave or mishandled the situation?Did they make a mistake in using the wrong method as a means to get the amount reduced?Did they not expect Sushiro's side to ask for an increase in compensation?,1,1
I have been waiting for an article like the author's on this issue.I would like to see a change in the times when articles and TV commentators who defend people who have done wrong and programs are made up.,1,1
"I don't know what you are talking about. ""We demand an explanation as to why all soy sauce bottles were discarded and replaced. I guess lawyers have to bend their own righteousness too, even if it is their job.",1,1
"Why did you replace all the bottles? I mean, since such a sickening act has become so widely known, everyone wonders if their favorite store is safe? I'm sure you're thinking, ""What's going on?That's why we are replacing them.If you had not done the licking in the first place, you would not have had to do it.All I can think is, you don't say that.",1,1
"All the reports seem to indicate that they don't seem to understand why they were socially sanctioned. I hope they don't get additional social sanctions again, including those around them, but in Japan there are so many people who want to beat you to death.",1,1
"I believe that social sanctions are only possible if the person is remorseful.As far as I have heard his answer, there is no remorse at all.If it is only 67 million yen, he should pay it meekly.I expect further claims.",1,1
"I understand what the advocacy argument means. If we calmly analyze the circumstances of that boy's assault, we will not be licking our chops to the store's all over the country. We need to think more dispassionately.",1,1
"You posted it on social media and said you ""didn't mean to spread the word"".That excuse is too bitter, lol.I'd rather just quantify the damage that we can see, but I'm sure there's more damage that should be done.Even I, who am commenting here, have become afraid to go out to eat at a family-affiliated restaurant. How will you take responsibility for that?",1,1
I think she looks cute.I knew I didn't like it from a consumer's point of view.If the boys hadn't made a video of their prank.They wouldn't have been exposed.I think you should teach your kids that posting videos on social media is just a way for influencers to make money off of you.,1,1
"It was never my intention to spread the video.""This sentence makes me angry. It's a self-protection that says if the influencer hadn't spread the video, I wouldn't be in this situation.The world is blaming him for the annoying act of licking soy sauce, and no one cares that he spread the video.",1,1
"I completely quit going to Sushiro because of this!I am sure there are many people who have stopped going there as I did, and I think it has had a huge impact on Sushiro's sales.",1,1
"Normally, they would replace all of them.In reality, companies are doing this out of a sense of desperation to make their customers feel safe by replacing everything for sanitary reasons.The problem would not have occurred without the naming practice in the first place.",1,1
"What the boy did was wrong.This is something that everyone, even the boy himself, acknowledges.But if you look at the soy sauce on the table, for example, if you sneeze, you will be splashed with it, and if you hold it in your hand, you will get it dirty. A small child might do the same thing when his parents are not looking. It was only discovered because the boy posted the image on social media. It was a potential problem, but it only became apparent in this case. Whose burden is it to pay for the countermeasures?Sushiro was the one with the bomb.",1,1
"Sushiro's overly lenient response is making Sushi-Perot take advantage of them.Since customer trust comes first, we replaced all the bottles, and the stock price dropped 16 billion because of the news. In other words, the stock price has dropped 16 billion due to the spread of the soy sauce bottle-slurping video. But that's impossible.",1,1
"We must never allow any behavior that threatens food safety.If it were a smaller restaurant, it would go bankrupt.Sushiro is a strong restaurant, so it was able to hold on.",1,1
"Why did they switch bottles? I wonder who is saying that.If it is from a lawyer, it is outrageous, and it can only mean that Japan's public safety will not improve because such a person is a lawyer.Normally, if something like this happened, it would be natural to replace everything.Well, if the perpetrator is saying this, there will be no remorse.",1,1
"I haven't been to Sushiro since I saw that video.　Before that, I used to go there quite often.I think there are a lot of people like that.　I think there are a lot of people like that, who are trying to imitate me again, and I don't know what they are doing out of sight.",1,1
"&gt; ""We demand an explanation as to why all soy sauce bottles were discarded and replaced.""Not an explanation, but an explanation? Are you sure you understand Japanese? Explanation is a word used by a perpetrator to excuse his actions, not a word required of a victim, right?If this is true, Sushiro should file a lawsuit about being asked to explain. At the very least, they deserve to be pissed off.",1,1
"It's only natural to replace all of them. Even if a hitter got into the ice cream case at a convenience store, it was a total replacement.",1,1
"Considering the position of the person who complains that he or she is the manager of the company and has to protect the employment of many employees and their families, there is no way that he or she can pretend that the fact that he or she caused great damage to the company did not exist just because he or she is sorry for his or her actions.",1,1
"Being a lawyer is a tough job, isn't it?I have to defend and refute what these people have done with reason.I'm not sure if Sushiro's claim is valid or not, but the majority of the people should vote on it. I really don't feel good about this appeal. Please work hard and pay up.",1,1
"Well, since this is probably a sentence thought up by the defense team, it is unlikely to be the words of the perpetrator in their entirety, or possibly worse.But you have to take responsibility for what you did, and the repercussions are much greater than you realize.If these are his own words...I guess he doesn't feel sorry.",1,1
"That's all I'm saying, that's all I did! Anger.From the customer's side, it's normal to wonder if this store is okay and if this bottle is okay.The store will do what they can to dispel it.You really don't know anything.",1,1
Japan should be allowed to claim punitive damages like the US.I would not be surprised if tens of billions of yen would be demanded for this incident in the US.,1,1
"I wonder what happened to the other ""boy who spread (uploaded) the video""? If the side of the boy who did this says so much (stands up for) Sushiro, it seems like there might be a lawsuit from the boy's side against the boy who uploaded it to SNS, saying that he ""didn't pay attention to the act and encouraged it"" or ""if he hadn't put it on the Internet, this situation wouldn't have happened"".Will it be erased in the face of Sushi Pero's overwhelming evilness?",1,1
"What do those who say to the perpetrator that much, or that they are sorry, or that the amount is too high, think on the contrary?The inconvenience to the other party is not just that person, the store, alone!There are dozens and thousands of people involved, including affiliated stores, suppliers, etc.They all have families! They pay rent.They have lives!If you feel the way you do about the perpetrators, why don't you make a donation to the victim stores or corporations?I can't help but think, ""Why don't you donate to the victim stores and corporations?It's just ridiculous!",1,1
"Well, they should be held accountable for what they did, but is the amount of this bill justified?Hasn't there been a decline in sales for some time?If the restaurant is involved in any misconduct in the future.I think there will be more repercussions than before.",1,1
"I don't understand why you quit high school, though. If he quit on his own, I don't know, and if the school forced him out, isn't the school's response the problem?I mean, that doesn't seem like the attitude of someone who is truly remorseful.",1,1
"It's not a matter of filing a claim for a reduction against the compensation.It is the right of the perpetrator, so there is no problem.The lawyer's job is to raise the issue of Sushiro'sIt is the job of the lawyer to raise the issue and reduce the amount of compensation.Someone else is making a mistake in pointing this out.",1,1
"If the boy was sincerely sorry for what he did, I don't think he would have sent this kind of defense letter.I expect Sushiro to win the entire case in court so that he can face what he did.I don't understand those who defend the boy. I want them to confront those who are mistaken and tell them that it is a big mistake if they think they can tolerate anything just because he is a juvenile.",1,1
I can no longer go to Kaiten Sushi because I feel sick after learning about this incident.This is a direct decrease in sales.You spent a lot of money to take countermeasures.You've caused damage and you have nothing to do with it...This is not the place to listen to excuses from children.,1,1
"I guess I should admit some of it.However, it appears that Sushiro is also claiming a portion that is difficult to find a causal relationship. The prank prevention portion is an expense that should be borne by Sushiro.",1,1
"It is a very common argument for the defendant in a civil lawsuit. It is one thing to feel remorse or regret for what you have done, and another to accept all of the other party's demands.",1,1
"I've never seen a social networking site that defended the perpetrator, but then again, I haven't checked all of them, so there might be one in a thousand. I guess it is the media's job to find such things...some people write on social networking sites for the purpose of inflaming and inciting others to do the same.",1,1
Public voices are only expressing their own opinions under their own responsibility.The opinion of the lawyers is a natural assertion of their work.The rest is for the judiciary to decide.,1,1
"There is no doubt that the juvenile is ""bad"" but it is very interesting from the perspective of ""appropriate sentencing based on the law"". I wonder what kind of sentence will be handed down.",1,1
"I don't think Sushiro thinks they can take this kind of amount, and Perosuke's side has no choice but to do it for a reduced amount.Regardless, the influencers who were involved in the spread should be compensated as well.",1,1
"What the heck, I don't get it.What is wrong to do is wrong to do.That's the premise, isn't it?So, should we put a notice on our official website saying that we've replaced only the soy sauce jug with a new one?Should we put it on the official website?It's also the way for a company to take countermeasures, isn't it?",1,1
"Whether it's a bottle of soy sauce or a teacup, you can't be trusted to keep it clean if you don't know which one it is, and you can't be trusted to change it all.Even for a competitor, if the timing of the spread caused a drop in sales, anyone can see that the action caused a drop in sales because it damaged the credibility of the company.I feel sorry for lawyers who can only fight in that kind of situation.",1,1
"The ""high school expulsion"" and ""disruption of a peaceful life"" are the result of your own actions, not the fault of others or Sushiro.Don't be causal, just put yourself in the other person's shoes and think about the question you asked.For me, that video was the deciding factor in my decision not to go to Kaiten Sushi.",1,1
"High school expulsion"" and ""disruption of a peaceful life"" have nothing to do with Sushiro.You can utter those things all you want when seeking a reduced sentence in criminal court.If it means he is a minor, then the person with parental authority should take civil responsibility.",1,1
"I know it's impossible, but looking at the content of this dispute, shouldn't the boy's side also seek compensation from those who spread the word (or those who had the power to spread the word, since it's impossible for all of them to do so) and pay the amount of compensation to all of them?",1,1
"The mysterious story that the incident caused the stock price to drop and caused a loss of 16 billion was often told by people who didn't seem to know anything about stocks. Other than that, I think it's mostly reasonable.",1,1
"Rebuttal = excuse,Will this boy not understand until he is old enough?Would he understand if the boy were in the field and enrolled in the company?The company just did what it was supposed to do.And how much did the labor costHow much did the labor cost for doing the obvious?Whether or not he leaves high school is his own problem.",1,1
"Why did you replace all the bottles?What? Huh? Huh?Do you have to ask me to know the answer to this question?Is this an adult asking this?If so, that's amazing.In a way, I'm impressed that you don't know the answer to a question you can easily imagine.",1,1
"Well, I was concerned about the possibility of this boy being defended by people who beat him up on the internet to relieve stress.To begin with, Sushiro wouldn't have had to deal with this if there weren't people making a fuss on the Internet, and I think the Sushiro side honestly thinks that people who make a fuss on the Internet every time are annoying... (I know they wouldn't say that because it would cause a firestorm...)",1,1
"Not enough remorse for what they did.I knew the juvenile law would diminish his sense of guilt.They think they can get away with it anyway.Juvenile or youth, there is no difference in the magnitude of the crime.I promote the abolition of the Juvenile Law.",1,1
"All Japanese citizens are victims in that they have committed an act that has destroyed the safety of food service in Japan.From that perspective, it is still naive, in my opinion.",1,1
"It's not about social sanctions, it's about how you are as a person. Also, if we don't replace everything, normal people won't like it, will they? A service that is based on the principle of ""goodness,"" you'd think there were other people like that, wouldn't you? I don't think you need to defend your personal chicks.",1,1
"In the article, it says, ""Even at this juncture, the media's defense of the perpetrators is conspicuous.""I think I read some newspapers every day, but I don't remember such an article standing out...which article are you talking about?",1,1
"This will go as far as it will go.The expression ""shock"" in the boy's shocking rebuttal is probably in response to the lack of remorse.If they had shown remorse and sincerity, Sushiro's attitude might have softened....",1,1
"If ""I'm sorry"" were enough, this kind of prank would never end. 67 million yen (620 stores x 100,000 yen) is the minimum.　If you think you can get away with this, you are mistaken.　I hope Sushiro and others will soon be able to do business as usual!",1,1
"We demand an explanation as to why all soy sauce bottles were discarded and replaced.""I don't know if it was the wisdom of their lawyers, but I don't know what kind of nerve they have to say something like this...Can you drink water from a used ""urinalysis cup"" that was offered to you saying ""I washed it well""?",1,1
"Wasn't it you and your family, not Sushiro, who decided to expel you?What you did is something that everyone knows you should not do. Now that you have done it, you should live your life with self-discipline so that no one will be ashamed of you in the future.It is embarrassing to hear such an objection.",1,1
"In order to know whether or not the juvenile offender is truly remorseful, it is necessary to see him in court until he pays compensation and makes full payment. Unfortunately, the family's assurances of remorse are meaningless.",1,1
"Even if the boy says he is sorry, he might do it again when the heat dies down! He can say as many times as he wants that he will never do it, but after some time or years, he is likely to do it again, and that's why Kura Sushi's treatment is justified!",1,1
"For Sushiro, in order to recover from the image damage, it would have been necessary to renew the items provided, including those at other restaurants. The perpetrator's argument lacks remorse. Well - the issue is for the court to decide.",1,1
"No, there is no need to give any consideration to the juvenile side. All you have to do is to conduct the court proceedings in a calm and solemn manner. It is seen in the repetitive nature of juvenile cases that the juveniles will do even worse in the future.",1,1
"It means that social life is tough!Even the student community can be tough.Expulsion is voluntary, isn't it?They call it a social sanction,But that's the same as the Ikebukuro car accident.It doesn't change the fact that he did it.",1,1
"Sushiro is right. This is a malignant folly that undermines the very foundation of safety and security.What kind of a mouthful to say that clearly does great damage to a company.If the compensation is fixed this time, will it be a deterrent and will there be fewer idiots?",1,1
"After watching that video, I don't think anyone would want to go to conveyor-belt sushi restaurants anymore. Not only Sushiro, but other conveyor-belt sushi chains must have lost sales, so other conveyor-belt sushi chains should also claim compensation.",1,1
"There are infinitely fewer advocates to begin with.Both online and real opinions.If it seems like a lot, it's just because you're not terribly net-literate enough to perceive a lot of minority opinions.",1,1
"This damage award will never go through.It will probably be lowered considerably in court.I've seen so many people give me a blue slip when I write that.I'm not denying the damages and the amount.There are too many people who can't distinguish between the two.By the way, Horie, who Matsumoto said wasn't funny, also wrote that too many people confuse ""not funny"" with ""dislike"".",1,1
"It's such a stupid thing to do in the first place that even the proliferation couldn't have been foreseen anyway. It's a social sanction that includes compensation, and I have nothing but sympathy for Sushiro.If he is remorseful, he has no choice but to accept it and make amends for the rest of his life.There is no such thing as a small or large crime.",1,1
"I think the perpetrator's lawyer is going to have a tough time.One person's disruptive behavior could have affected the entire restaurant.They're trying to make sure they don't lose somehow, but it's going to be difficult.",1,1

"＞Why do you defend only the perpetrators...?I'm a lawyer for the juvenile side, so I'm forced to defend them, so I'm sure you'll argue that.The replacement of all the bottles and the factors that led to the decrease in sales, etc., are also kicked out of the case when they are refuted, and they are not even points of contention.Isn't that a sign that the defense is also struggling?",1,1
I hope that there will be no half-hearted settlements in order to cut off the rest of the world from following suit.I hope that this will set a harsh precedent so that people will not think that this is all they will get in the end.,1,1

"You did something you absolutely shouldn't have done, so don't argue with me or anything. Even in the pre-Corona era, it was out of line, and even in the Corona era, when you should have known better enough. The damage to the restaurant and its patrons is considerable.",1,1
"If a customer asked you, how would you answer? What would you say if a customer asked you if you had changed the soy sauce container? The customer would feel uncomfortable, right? If the customer replies that he/she has replaced the container, then the customer can eat or drink with satisfaction. It is only natural for all stores to replace their equipment! I would like to ask those who criticize Sushiro. What would you do if you were the victim? If this were the U.S., you'd be liable for ""astronomical"" compensation!",1,1
Those who defend them should look at the comments of Kitamura's lawyer!Sushiro is not the only one who is allocating expenses for preventive measures against nuisances in this case.Even those who are defending the restaurant are wondering if it is safe to enter the restaurant. I'm sure it crosses your mind for even a moment.It's such a huge crime that it has had such an impact on the whole of Japan and has overturned the culture of eating out!,1,1
"The juvenile's side of the story is the story of the lawyer whose job it is to defend this juvenile.Of course, if you are defending the boy, you want to reduce his damages no matter how difficult it is to do so. As long as there is a video, it is unacceptable to say that he did not do it.",1,1
"Notoriety trumps obscurity!If you work with Hikaru or Yamaguchi as a YouTuber, you can pay off even 100 million yen in less than a year.I mean, Hikaru should pay it off once!",1,1
"Is it Sushiro's fault that you got expelled from school? If a working adult did something like that and got fired from the company, no one would defend him, because a high school student should be able to judge what's right and wrong to do.",1,1

"The economy is greatly influenced by the truth of the buyer. Even I, who don't pay much attention to details, wonder if the soy sauce jugs and gari containers at conveyor-belt sushi restaurants are clean. Are there any foreign substances in them? I can't help but wonder if there are any foreign substances in them. It was a bad move on the part of the lawyers to ignore those unquantifiable details and ask for immunity.",1,1
"They've done a lot of bait-and-switch ads, beer sale scams, etc. before...I'm sure it had an impact on the number of customers and other things.But the replacement cost and the bill for the acrylic panels should be billed to the boy.",1,1
"&gt; It wasn't about the purpose of spreading it.It doesn't matter what the purpose of spreading it was .... It's just compensation for the act of taking away Sushiro's credibility. The person who spread the soy sauce may be a nuisance to Sushiro, but if he had not licked the soy sauce, it would not have happened.",1,1
"I think it's an interesting point of contention, and the fact that you've taken a step in the direction of holding the spreaders socially responsible is quite innovative and could serve as a benchmark for the future.Personally, I think the boy's behavior should not be tolerated and Sushiro is a victim, so he is free to do whatever he wants, but the fact that the outside world is making a big fuss about the child and calling for heavy penalties is... disgraceful.I'm not so much defending the boy as I am the ugliness of the adults ranting in the comments section.",1,1
"If we respond leniently here, there will be those who will engage in similar criminal acts again.We need to take firm and tough action to protect the safety and credibility of food service.In the first place, there is no need to tolerate such a dirty act.",1,1
"I always think that the amount of damage should have been stopped after it was spread on social networking sites, but the media reported it 24/7, which further spread the word to those who are not on social networking sites, increasing the total amount of damage.Of course, it was his own fault before it was spread.",1,1
"I'm so much more protected in criminal trials, but civil is tough. Why are they protected? The purpose is to rehabilitate the juvenile. I think it should be civil as well. Because this juvenile has been expelled and seems to be remorseful. I would be in trouble with my parents and I would feel like dying. Would you rather go to jail?",1,1
"If this had happened in the Showa Era, when the Internet was less widespread, an apology would have been in order.But now, in an age where people can profit (and make a living) from unnecessary information just for the fun of it and to show off, they probably think that there will only be more copycats in the future and that they need a wake-up call for the future, not that they will receive compensation.",1,1
"I think this is a good case for damages.However, Sushiro is also doing a lot of things, such as hype advertising and putting up posters in front of beer discounts.Sushiro is Sushiro, and they do some pretty bad things, don't they?",1,1
This level of punishment is not even recognizable.They should be made to pay the usual imprisonment and compensation in the hundreds of millions of dollars.Forced.Don't forget that this will be involved in the future increase of crimes!,1,1
"＞Why defend only the perpetrators?Only the perpetrator can be defended.The only other person who can be defended is the photographer, but the photographer has not been claimed for compensation, so there is nothing to be defended.Therefore, this headline is wrong.

That's just a bitter rebuttal. Whether or not this action has had any effect on the decline in sales is obvious from the transition. There is no need to make a fuss. All that remains is to see how many extenuating circumstances there will be. That's all there is to it.,1,1

"Regardless of whether it is an adult or a juvenile, I think Japanese law is too kind to the perpetrators and should be more accommodating to the victims.",1,1
Why don't we just average all the opinions and make the boy pay back the 67 million yen with his labor?Wouldn't that be better so that he can't go bankrupt and run away?,1,1
">Why did he replace all the bottles?What Peropero did was not only ruin one bottle, but also damaged the credibility of Sushiro and its social image.So you did it because you needed to give a broad impression that you were taking firm measures to dispel that.What this rebuttal shows is that Peropero still doesn't understand what he did.How can he say he's sorry for what he did?",1,1
"Yes, replacing all the bottles is unnecessary, and it is an act of unjust enrichment to make the boy pay illegally for his actions.Being a victim doesn't mean you're allowed to do anything you want.",1,1
"Japan is a nation governed by the rule of law.It doesn't matter what was beaten up in the media.It is a separate issue.Quibbling, saying all kinds of excuses, but it's a scenario that lawyers have come up with.It's extraordinarily antagonistic, and I'm not sure about the skill of the lawyers.I don't think he and his family have that much brains.If they did, they wouldn't be doing stupid things.",1,1
"Decreased sales? Isn't that just overpriced? Make the rice smaller. If you think about the costumers, you might get more customers. I'm reluctant to comment on the perroppo incident.I can't go to eat there because I don't have a restaurant. Good luck, Sushiro-san. m(_ _)m",1,1
"For example, if you were running a restaurant and the same thing happened to you and you could no longer run the restaurant because you had no customers, would you still be able to say, ""It was a youthful indiscretion and I can't help it. I wonder if they would be able to say, ""It was a youthful indiscretion and it can't be helped.",1,1
"They are desperate to reduce the amount of compensation as much as possible. I guess the lawyers have no choice but to make such a mess. As others have said, social sanctions have nothing to do with civil cases.",1,1
"I think there were many factors that contributed to the decline in sales. But there is no doubt that Sushipero is one of the major factors.I don't think you can argue with that! Are you seriously sorry that you say you are sorry, but when it comes to claims for compensation and such, you argue against it?",1,1
"I used to go to a sushi restaurant twice a month,But after watching the video, I have never been to a sushi restaurant,I have never been to a sushi restaurant since I saw that video.I think there are other people like me,I think the amount of the bill is reasonable.On the contrary, I think it's too little.",1,1

You didn't let yourself spread the word, did you? It was you who gave permission to make the video, and it was you who acted in it. Normally, I wouldn't do that.",1,1
"If the story hadn't gotten so big, and if he hadn't been arrested, he would have done it all over again. He probably still thinks naively that he's just a kid. That's why I'm refuting you. People who are truly remorseful don't argue.",1,1
"The decline in sales is probably due to quality. It used to be good, but now I don't think so... But now I don't think so at all...But even in udon shops, there are people who put a heap of green onions or a heap of tenkasu....",1,1
"In Japan, court decisions come out very late, so if the final verdict comes out in, say, five years or so, by that time most people will be saying, ""You're still talking about something that happened so long ago? I think most people will laugh at the final verdict in 5 years.",1,1
"If you or your family members were self-employed, would you be able to say the same thing if you or your family members suffered a great deal of damage from the same thing?Without asking for compensation, would you be able to say, ""I hope you can help my store and reform yourself,"" or ""I feel sorry for you because you've already been socially sanctioned, and I forgive you""?I would never be able to say that.",1,1
We can't rule out the possibility that the video went viral and there were copycats.I think this alone would be reason enough to replace all the stores...,1,1
"If you want to reduce the burden of compensation, shouldn't you demand that your friends who spread the news pay their fair share, instead of demanding it of Sushiro?",1,1
"For Sushiro, it is really a good inconvenience.It was like being suddenly attacked by a street demon.As for how to handle the situation afterwardsIf we forgive them, we will be criticized by public opinion,And if you sue, you will be blamed by public opinion.I think it's a real nuisance.",1,1
I think that the reason why there are so many in the media who defend the perpetrators is because the media itself feels that it is okay to cause trouble for others if it serves their purposes.There must be a similarity between the two.,1,1

"Sushipero is dirty.But before that..,Sushiro's teacups are dirty from the start.It's not clean at all.Try wiping it with a hand towel before using it.It will turn really green.",1,1
"But you have soy sauce jugs and lanes in a state where anyone can do something like that, right? That's how it's structured.It's not that boy's fault.It's just that the boy was the trigger that exposed it.And it only took the trigger to fix the structure.And it had nothing to do with the stock price.Sushiro is trying to put the boy on the hook for unrelated damages.Frankly speaking, it's not good for the image.",1,1

"I have started to avoid restaurants where condiments and cups are self-serve not only at Sushiro but also at restaurants.That is definitely the influence of Sushipero.I'm not saying I'm a germaphobe, but just the thought of some filthy person's saliva on my food makes me lose my appetite.",1,1

"The discipline from now on will not be about the inconvenience to others....It is necessary to teach the children and families that ""Net Tattooing"" is a private crime with no statute of limitations, no matter how heinous or misdemeanor it may be.It is necessary to teach this in compulsory education and at home.",1,1
"If you feel that much about it, reimburse them with the people you're feeding.At that time, the crisis of the conveyor-belt sushi chain, and by extension, the restaurant industry itself, was being questioned, and they would not have been able to just replace the product in question and call it a day. They could not have just exchanged the product in question and called it a day.",1,1
"The expulsion was voluntary, and compensation was deserved. In the first place, if there was no malicious intent, the shooting itself would not have taken place. I don't think it's possible to say anything. He is not sorry for what he did. The claim for compensation was right! But...?",1,1
"The damage caused by Sushiro is cheap, and the public should be made aware of the seriousness of the situation. I am disappointed in the world where this comment is made.",1,1
"The discussion should be based on the victim's position.It doesn't matter to the victim whether the perpetrator is expelled, remorseful, etc.I don't understand why you are trying to protect the perpetrators.Can you forgive someone who has done you a great deal of damage just because he or she expelled you from school and is sorry for what he or she did?",1,1
"People who say ""why"" about replacing all bottles are out of their minds.... There is no way that a restaurant can just replace the bottles for reasons of hygiene and the possibility that there may be others besides this girl.

It's a strange world we live in.",1,1

"Social punishment is meaningless, because Sushiro doesn't want that. Since this is a civil suit, Sushiro's demand is for compensation for damages. Social sanctions are in the realm of criminal cases.Frankly, I don't think it's as unpredictable as this article makes it out to be. Also, I think the court is also concerned about public opinion and will not be able to make a lenient ruling. They don't want to set a bad precedent.",1,1

I can't allow it if I think it might be my restaurant next time.",1,1
"I think one of the main reasons for the decline in sales is the disguised campaign!I thought that sea urchins and other sea urchin products were still natural, but when I found out that they were out of stock in the morning during the draft beer campaign, I decided to stop going.Because it's like they are trying to scam you.",1,1
"I no longer go to Sushiro.Not because of the boy's case, but simply because I decided as a consumer that the price and the product were not worth it.",1,1

The focus is only on the amount of damages suffered by Sushiro in that case. The attributes of the other party are irrelevant. The court should solemnly calculate a reasonable amount of damages.,1,1
"Even if you replace only one, the customer won't know which one was replaced with a new one. If you say you couldn't predict the spread of the problem, it's as if you just uploaded the information and released it to the whole world.",1,1

It is nonsense for outsiders to get angry at every single ""argument"" from the juvenile side. Even if the amount of damages is considerably reduced, it will be enough to ruin the boy's life. For those who have the discernment to fear, it is a deterrent. Unfortunately, it is the kids who don't have that insight who do this.",1,1

The reason sales went down is because you guys lost out to other restaurants, don't blame me.""I'm sorry. That's enough, isn't it? So stop talking about compensation, I'm a poor minor.......

"Not only in this case, but from the end of the Heisei era to the present, Japan has become a country where the perpetrators are as gentle as a feather quilt in a mild spring day.

Otherwise, this kind of bad behavior will never disappear! The ordinary shareholders should also be charged for their unrealized losses due to the price of their shares. The impact on the world is immeasurable!",1,1
"I see that they are surprised at the amount of damages and are resisting.There is no way to know how much damage Sushiro has suffered in monetary terms. We don't even know if it's fair. But I do know one thing for sure. It was ""you did it. It was not Sushiro who expelled him.",1,1
"Disposal and replacement of all soy sauce bottles,is necessary,Japan is the world's most class and fussy country when it comes to product quality and work efficiency,Firstly, to restore credibility, secondly, to improve efficiency and cost performance, and thirdly, to be disciplined,If you don't understand this, you should leave Japan,If you don't understand this, you should leave Japan.",1,1
I don't think the boys are solely responsible for the drop in sales.I think it is also due to the fact that they over-advertised a while ago.I'm not defending the boy one bit.,1,1
"In short, they don't want to compensate you, so they are just trying to somehow justify their accusations. For example, if something happens, tens of thousands of products are recalled in order to maintain food safety. The same goes for replacing all the bottles. Changing only the ones you lick is a mockery of the food and beverage industry. Don't play hard to get, just pay up.",1,1
"When I went to a restaurant and they didn't have any seasonings, I asked.I asked him about it and he said, ""They can't put it there anymore because of the Sushiro incident.I realized that it had become inconvenient because of him.",1,1
"Do I need to change every bottle?　I guess that's a shallow way of thinking that everything in the video is necessary, but people have different ways of thinking, and it's better to be absolutely reassured that some people think it's okay to change only the actual product, while others are worried about all of them. If you think it's too much, then you don't have to do such a shitty crime.",1,1
"It would make sense for the influencer to pay about half of the $67,151,770. Wouldn't it be better for the boy's side to be rotten about getting the influencer's side involved?",1,1
"From the beginning, you should have enough teacups for everyone, and soy sauce in goldfish or sachets,And disposable chopsticks for the number of people!I've done it before with toddlers.I've done it with toddlers, too!　I've even been known to get into a big tantrum in front of the sushi lane....It's bad to leave an extra number of sushi!Sushi-lo is not so good at this... or maybe he needs to use his imagination...",1,1
"We are not going to forgive the perpetrators.I think we need to make an example to prevent the next victim.However, I felt that this issue was also abnormal for those who spread the word.",1,1
"This is the kind of story that will be told in the text of the trial. I think the verdict will be harsh. After that, Sushiro's side will make a decision.",1,1
"As a food service company, ""food hygiene"" is absolute.If there is a threat to this, the need for a new replacement is a given.If you say that the decline in sales is partly due to competitive factors, then of course your competitors' sales are up, right?Why don't you prove that?This is not a ""rebuttal"", it's just a kid's quibble.The poor quality of lawyers who let them say that...",1,1
"This incident comes at a time when the price hike has been keeping customers away. The number of customers at Sushiro in the neighborhood has drastically decreased after this incident. It is deserted even on weekends. The number of part-timers has decreased, and who is going to guarantee their reduced living expenses? There is no room for sympathy!",1,1
"Can the attorney in charge and his family use it all without discarding it?No amount of quibbling will convince me.That's how much they've done.If they want to reduce the amount of compensation, they'd better make a good faith demand.This is counterproductive.",1,1
"Went to Sushiro, but only ordered items were flowing, probably because of the incident. The old man was being shown how to use the boat, but he said he didn't know how to use the boat, but he didn't have a clue.",1,1
"Did you really replace everything?I mean, given the way Sushiro has beenConsidering how Sushiro has been deceiving consumersIt is possible that they have not been replaced.If the manager is lax, depending on the store, it is possible.It is possible.",1,1
"I rather welcome these unsolicited videos because now that they have been brought to light, the shops will take stronger sanitary measures. This is because now that the reality has been brought to light, the restaurant will take stronger sanitary measures.",1,1
"Not foreseeing the proliferation is a grade-school level statement. How can you say such a thing, when there have been so many annoying acts that have spread all over the Internet? You could have foreseen it.",1,1
"If it is enough that he is sorry, there will be more victims in the future.Even if it is not the full amount, a claim for damages is necessary to let the world know the seriousness of the situation.",1,1
Social sanctions are the seeds you sowI think that the recent outburst of the Internet and the media is the cause.I think it is the right thing to do to have a proper trial and to decide the verdict.,1,1
"If this boy does not receive the appropriate retribution, I do not think the world will be silent anymore.The reason he was expelled from school was for his own reasons, not Sushiro's responsibility or anything else.",1,1
"We all know that there is no way they can pay anyway, so I think they should pay the full amount of the bill. They show no signs of remorse, and they should be made to take responsibility for what they have done.",1,1
"Social sanction is just something you got on your own, but Sushiro hasn't given you any social sanction yet, right?It's just the beginning, right?It's not Sushiro's fault that they were socially sanctioned by others.",1,1
"&gt; In the midst of all this, the juvenile side's answer has become a hot topic. Why did you replace all the bottles?"" The boy's side asked Sushiro the question, and the truth of the question is: .......To begin with, this is a matter of course, not a defense.",1,1
"If you want, wouldn't you even want to claim damages from other conveyor-belt sushi restaurants besides Sushiro?I think it's a separate issue for Sushiro to claim damages and for the boy to be socially sanctioned. He would have uploaded the video thinking it would be a puzzler himself, and he just got the buzz he wanted.",1,1
"In the end, the boy's side just wants to reduce the amount of the fee somehow.I hope that this kind of claim will be brushed off and the result will be quick enough to make the other bums shudder.",1,1
"I apologized and I got away with it.The boy said. I'm sorry. I got away with it. But I'm sorry.If you were sorry, you wouldn't have said, ""I got away with it.""",1,1
I think the number of customers has decreased since that video. At least my family has not been going there since then. I think we are also victims because we can no longer go to Sushiro.,1,1
"You are too much of a good guy! I won't be going to Sushiro anymore either!When the problem was discovered, it was reported that the number of customers was decreasing and they were having a hard time, so I went there to support them, even if only a little, but it was just a hypocritical company.",1,1
"Yes?You can't bother people, can you?Who wants to use someone's spattered soy sauce and plates?Maybe others? Of course you don't want to go there.What did your parents teach you? Did you teach them that it's okay to get other people in trouble as long as it's good enough for you?Why did this happen?It's not Sushiro's fault,",1,1
"I didn't mean to spread the word, it was the influencers who spread the word, that's what the internet is all about.Once you put it online, the world is watching.You are showing your foolishness to the world.",1,1
"You're free to charge whatever amount you want.If you could get it, it would be several million. Maybe a few hundred thousand.It would only be for a few days' profit of the affected store and the actual cost of the exchange.",1,1
"The compensation is not much. I don't want to go to a conveyor belt sushi chain anymore after learning about this incident. I think they do it at other chain restaurants too. I thought, ""I'm not going to go there anymore. Sushiro is also causing trouble to other conveyor-belt sushi chain restaurants. Don't think it's just that one restaurant!",1,1
"This assailant has also been arrested on a separate kidnapping charge.Sushiro should claim compensation for the loss, including the stock drop.",1,1
"Too much risk management on Sushiro's part.Not to this extent, but we've seen similar incidents before.They just pretended not to notice.Kids touching them, drunks spitting all over them, etc.",1,1
"Most people in the world know, as a matter of course, that this is what happens when you absolutely do something like this (Sushipero).I think Sushiro is reasonable.I think it means that they have done that much.",1,1
"You say you're on a day of reflection, but am I the only one who doesn't seem to be reflecting on whether you needed to replace the bottles, or whether the drop in sales was not your fault?",1,1
"Since this incident, I no longer go to revolving sushi restaurants.If I do anything out of the ordinary, I have to pay tens of millions of yen in court,I am too scared to go there.And I was even expelled from high school.　Oh, scary, scary.I wonder if there will be more and more people saying ""Oh, scary, scary.",1,1
"If it's a malicious peroperation, you'll have to replace the whole thing.For non-malicious peroperty, just wash it in the washer.What's the difference?If a child pees, pees, or throws up, do you change everything?If an adult throws up in a restaurant, do you change everything?If an adult throws up in a cab, do you replace everything?",1,1
That's a nonsensical rebuttal.The lawyer needs to give him a chance to reflect on what he's done...The most he can do is negotiate a reduction in the amount.I think you'll lose all credibility as a lawyer if you keep putting up wild logic.,1,1
"Regardless of whether or not the boy intended to spread the video, it is an undeniable fact that what he did was a crime and that the business suffered damages.It is only natural to hold the culprit responsible for the damage he caused.Wouldn't those who are defending the boy's actions hold the culprit responsible for the arson attack on his house?That is the level of the story.",1,1
"I think it's just for show.It's one of those pranks that started on social media and became a big problem, but it's one of those pranks that have been around for a long time.I wish the perpetrator had never done this in the first place.",1,1
"If all it took was an apology, there would be no need for the police...In general, it is the perpetrator's convenience to apologize, and it is up to the victim to decide whether or not to accept the apology.If he/she says he/she should forgive because he/she has apologized, he/she is not sorry, and a stranger should not be irresponsible enough to say that he/she should forgive him/her because he/she has apologized.",1,1
"If they had offered to work without pay to clean up after closing and apologize in the kitchen, where customers can't see them, with Perot's owner and his friends who were excited about filming them, there would have been ""extenuating circumstances"". Well, I guess they are not the kind of people who would come up with such an idea.",1,1
"The expulsion is his own fault. As for the bottle containers, well, you have to change them or the customers won't like them, right? You have to show remorse not by words but by actions. It's difficult, but you have to do your best to live your life.",1,1
"This is the wrong person for the perpetrator to blame.If he was expelled from high school, and if that is what is bothering him,the blame should be directed at the high school.",1,1
"Well, since the damage was caused by the spreading and reporting of the news, I think that the people included in the spreading route caused a higher percentage of the damage.",1,1
"You shouldn't lick an adult's attitude toward work, said announcer Azumi.I guess that means Sushiro's seriousness about his work.",1,1
"If it was not your intention to spread the word and you were even expelled, why don't you file your own lawsuit against the famous influencer who spread the word?Let's stop blaming others!",1,1
"Lawyer, that's what I would come to.Indeed.Suppose there was an infidel who spread a video of fare nonpayment (kissel).If the railroad company modifies its system to prevent this, do you think they would charge the infidel tens of millions of dollars for the modification?",1,1
"I'm not advocating that at all. From the company's point of view, if sales decrease, it will not only affect the people they employ, but also their families. The sanctions are rather too gentle.",1,1
It is appalling to see so many cases of the perpetrator playing the victim these days.When did the Japanese people forget to apologize honestly?Is this another culture of other countries?,1,1
It will be necessary to destroy all bottles.It is impossible to prove that no one directly licked them. There is no way to prove the devil.,1,1
"How can anyone still write articles like this?We're already at the stage of silently watching the trial and it's annoying to the contrary.The overused title and the content we are already tired of hearing.I'm surprised, I didn't expect such a rehashed article at this point in time.",1,1
"There is a substantial damage of 16 billion yen drop in the stock price, isn't there? Personally, I think you should charge an additional 16 billion yen.",1,1
"In the concept of food defense, I think this incident is to be expected. We dare to choose an open form of sales because the kiya",1,1
I still haven't eaten convenience store oden since the incident. The damage to Sushiro will continue to occur. It can't be over and done with.,1,1
"Do you realize that the perpetrators are doing more damage than that?I don't know why people are defending them. The reason Sushiro was not driven out of business was because of its large parent company, but a normal restaurant would have gone out of business. Do you understand that?",1,1
"In the end, the amount of loss will be less than 5 million yen (replacement of equipment and court costs). There is no way to prove it, since Sushiro's stock price fell as a result of its fraudulent anti-company activities with decoy products in the previous year (laugh).",1,1
"Whether they are juveniles or adults, they should be held accountable for their actions. In fact, I still don't go to Kaiten Sushi. In fact, I still don't go to Kaiten Sushi, and I don't even think of going there.",1,1
"Reflection can be done even by monkeys. Human beings come with responsibilities. Sushiro did not expel the boy. We can only hope for a settlement with a sincere apology and the maximum possible compensation. If the boy is a minor, the liquidation of his parents' assets is unavoidable.",1,1
"Blaming Sushiro is out of the question, and it is such a problem that it could be worth more than 100 million yen in compensation. It is not a matter of regret.",1,1
"The actual damages will be much higher, and you don't want to pay a lot of money for damages... or is it common sense?",1,1
"In fact, I haven't been to Sushiro since then.And I doubt I will ever go there again.In a way, I'm grateful to Sushiro for reminding me how good the counter sushi restaurant is.I'm grateful in a way.",1,1
"What happened to the people who took and spread this video?I think we should work with those people and pay them.The boy's side of the argument is laughable.You know, usually...",1,1
The cause of all this is on the boy's side.But to blame the victim side is something strange.Are you really sorry for what you did? Or is it because you can't pay the compensationor are you making it difficult for the victim because you can't afford to pay compensation?,1,1
"To what extent is liability and what is the appropriateness of the amount?I don't know if there has ever been a precedent for this type of trial,I think it is a moderately difficult trial.",1,1
"I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but the wait times for conveyor belt sushi have decreased.It's partly because the prices have gone up.There's hardly a plate of food that's worth 110 yen.",1,1
If you look at Sushiro's sales.I know they have dropped quite a bit since 2020.Shouldn't they be charged for that?The boy's actions have caused a considerable drop in sales.,1,1
"You can't post a video on a social networking site and expect it to go viral.If he thought he was sharing the video among his friends, I'll give him a hundred paces, but since he didn't, the lawyer's logic is broken.",1,1
"I think there is no limit to the number of crimes that have been committed by young people as a result of the spread of the messed up videos, which were even called food terrorism on the Internet, and the number of copycats has increased among young people.",1,1
"As for the amount of 67 million yen already, it is very unprecedented.I think there is a lot of warmth in it.Overseas, even a low estimate would be several hundred million yen.And there is no mercy.In spite of the outrageous price, they are still complaining about it, so there is nothing we can do.",1,1
"I myself used to go to Sushiro every month, but didn't for about 6 months because of the Sushipero video, so I'm pretty sure I saw a decrease in sales.",1,1
Is the influencer or the platform not responsible?Considering that without either of these the damages would not have been amplified...,1,1
Can't we also claim damages from the person who spread the information?　I think we also need a clear law that makes it a crime to promote inappropriate content.,1,1
"People who post videos that cause losses to companies through TikTok and Tweeter should pay all the debts that companies have chased and all those who posted sushi pero, lighter-igniting high school girls, toothpicks from yakiniku restaurants, and red ginger from beef bowls should be compensated for their losses.",1,1
"The basic stance of those who defend it is ""contrarian"".It is a part of self-production, not a true intention.Therefore, most of what they say is narrow-minded and inconsistent.",1,1
"The boy himself is not a goner, the lawyer is just doing his job.Objective discussion is necessary, and both sides should be able to present their rationale and then bring it to a verdict.",1,1
"I think the most damage was done by the mass media, but if it's only on the Internet, only a small percentage of people will know about it, so it won't do much damage.",1,1
"Frankly speaking, it was a child's act, so give him a break. I don't think it's right for a company to go along with such a childish sanction. I will never go to Sushiro again.",1,1
"As a lawyer, this is the only part I can argue.At any rate, we have no choice but to attack every point that we can fry.",1,1
"He is claiming 67 million yen in damages this time... but if he goes to court, the amount will probably be reduced... so he will have to pay the damages according to the outcome of the trial - I guess he has no choice - too bad he didn't learn from his seniors, the bakkas.",1,1
"There have been many cases in the past where videos of nuisances have been spread? I get the same feeling from this defense team as the defense team that claimed that in one case ""Doraemon is...",1,1
"Why is it that Sushiro is not claiming any compensation from those involved in the company who seriously damaged the store's credibility through decoy advertisements, but is claiming over 60 million yen in damages from the boy in this case?Sushiro officials should first explain this to us.",1,1
"It's just that it spread on its own, but it started because the boy made a video and uploaded it.In this day and age, there have been flare-ups of byte terrorism, and even if they say they had no intention of spreading it, it doesn't make sense.",1,1
"I guess they played the hand of limiting the amount of damage by conferring with their lawyers. It's the right move, but it's also a move that makes you look bad in the eyes of society.",1,1
"Whether the juvenile receives social sanctions or not, the company will not receive a penny.This is not a reason to reduce damages.",1,1
"Those who say that the child is remorseful and should be forgiven should support the child by donating money for compensation. I think.After all, isn't it just a way of appealing to yourself to protect the perpetrator?I've been too scared to go to Kaitenzushi since then.",1,1
"I went to a major Muzoe yesterday and the rotating type place had some fries on the tag with the name of the item!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I guess no matter what happens, a certain number of weirdness never diminishes.",1,1
"You went to the trouble of making a video, and even made it available to the general public, not even in a keyed account,I don't intend to spread it.is a joke.On the other hand, if this is what you really think and say, you are too illiterate to be gagged.",1,1
"Isn't the photographer equally guilty?　Why compensate only the boy?But still, I think the lawyer's rebuttal only gives the impression that the boy has no remorse.",1,1
"&gt; ""We ask the plaintiff, Sushiro, for an explanation as to why all soy sauce bottles were discarded and replaced.I've never heard of asking a victim for an ""explanation"" before.Shouldn't it at least be ""Could you please explain?What a great lawyer you are.",1,1
"""The extremely subjective psychology of consumers.""I'm sure there are at least a number of customers who stopped going to Sushiro after watching this video.I'm sure there must be a lot of customers who stopped going to Sushiro after watching this video.",1,1
"The so-called ""hitter"" problem has been around for a long time.Despite this, this type of crime and nuisance has not stopped.Hence, I believe that a claim for high damages as a preventive measure against recurrence is of social significance.",1,1
"Sushiro's damages are a bit excessive.Is it just a media circus and a publicity stunt?I think the reason the stock price dropped is because customers got tired of Sushiro's sushi items.I think it was good when it first opened, but now it's just a bunch of weird stuff. There's nothing I want to eat, don't serve only desserts at a sushi restaurant, make money by catering to children.",1,1
That's because the juveniles and their lawyers are desperate if they have to pay 67 million yen if they keep quiet.I think the counterargument is only natural since it's a trial.But the arguments for the counterargument seem weak...,1,1
Why did you replace all the bottles? You made me imagine what else might have been done to you.It's tough being a lawyer.I can't believe I have to defend anyone.,1,1
"He says he has no intention to share it and does not expect it to spread, which means he has no remorse for his annoying behavior.I guess they were habitually causing trouble even before this case came to light.",1,1
"You are sorry, and it is not up to the perpetrator to decide whether or not he is sorry, but the victim. I don't think you are remorseful while you say you are.",1,1
"Spreading personal information until it interferes with your higher education or employment is too much! After reporting the incident, put down your phone and stay calm.",1,1
"There is not a single voice around me, not even one in ten, that is supportive of juveniles. But many judges in Japan are strange. Please give us a decent verdict that is in line with the will of the people.",1,1
The culprit's crime is quite serious because many customers will stop going to other stores because they think they might have done the same thing.,1,1
It's not just the perpetrator's fault that sales dropped because of the advertising fraud in the first place.I think Sushiro is being saved by the boy in a way.,1,1
">""Inhibition of peaceful living.""They are the ones who released the video exposing their faces.It is not as if they were secretly filmed and uploaded to the Internet without permission.Nowadays, if you publish a video on the Internet, you can't stop it from spreading without your permission.If they had at least hidden their faces, they could have pretended to be someone else and transferred to a different school or something....",1,1
"Having said that, I'm glad that Sushiro was the only one to claim damages. It would have been a blow to other conveyor-belt sushi restaurants and family restaurants.",1,1
"Right after this story spread.I remember a bit of excitement on the internet about ""Let's go to Sushiro.""I'm not sure I agree that this is separate from the damages.",1,1
"Peropero is to blame, but the act itself is only property damage. The person who should really be blamed is the person who retweeted it and the person who spread it, including the media.",1,1
"These objections on the part of the juvenile are probably only said by the lawyer and not by the juvenile himself (is he even smart enough to think about it?). If that is the case, I wonder how the lawyer can say something that escalates the situation. Is there something wrong with the lawyer too?",1,1
It's not an action taken by a preschooler.67 million yen? I thought it was a very reasonable price.,1,1
"The opinions defending the boy's side are conspicuous?It's just that the person who writes this can't understand that there are such opinions, so he/she sees a little bit of advocacy and feels that there are a lot of them.",1,1
"Well, with the usual reception, both the defendant and the defense organization take advantage of the juvenile case,I have the impression that both the defendant and the defense The defense organization is lucky if they get a fee.",1,1
"Considering how foolish this action was and how much of a negative impact it had on kaitenzus in Japan, even 10 billion yen would not be enough.",1,1
"How can you argue against it? After all, you still don't understand the gravity of the situation. To understand, please take the punishment to deter the future.",1,1
"It's not excessive at all. Unfortunately, consumers are not convinced otherwise. They would recall all products even if they were contaminated with a foreign substance. It's a waste, though.",1,1
"I could have done it as much as I wanted to, but I took measures to prevent it, you know?Of course, Pero-boy was the trigger, but I also feel that it is a necessary expense in terms of sanitation.I mean, it's not limited to Sushiro.There are plenty of well-meaning people who wouldn't do such a thing.Drink bar, I'm talking to you.",1,1
"If we don't judge within the proper rules, we will have lawlessness.Morality will make people unhappy if we don't give them knowledge and education.Those who are irresponsible and too strict have low moral values.",1,1
"Those who defend the perpetrators are just other people. If they were the ones involved, they wouldn't be able to say such things. I guess they lack imagination...",1,1
The issue of Sushiro deceiving consumers that preceded this boy's video.My whole family has stopped eating at Sushiro regardless of this boy.,1,1
Then on behalf of Sushiro.I'll ask you to pay the employee's salary for a year or so.How about paying them a year's salary?Didn't he cause that much trouble?Perhaps 67 million won't do the trick.,1,1
"I've always wondered what the point was in replacing all the soy sauce jugs.Customers don't care about that kind of thing, and replacing them doesn't guarantee that they won't be hit again.",1,1
The boy who asks about the disposal of all bottles should be able to prove that he did not lick any other bottles.,1,1
"Aren't we talking about two acts committed by two different people, ""annoying"" and ""spreading the video,"" and which one has the greater impact?",1,1
"Why did they replace all the bottles?""I don't know if this is the whole idea.It's too unimaginative.It's not like he wanted to do it.I wonder if the people defending him don't understand it either.",1,1
"It is the same as when a delinquent boy is rehabilitated, he is praised. If you are serious, they don't think anything of you.If you just show that you have reflected on your actions, you will be praised.",1,1
"If you lose your job due to a pay cut or store collapse because of this fiasco.No one will defend me.Even if the unemployment is extreme, they probably lost their bonuses.",1,1
"Maybe it's a lawyer's strategy, but are you consciously provoking them?　I work for a food company, and I am inclined to have Sushiro do a thorough job.",1,1
"If Sushiro pulls out, they will say that he is ""pussyfooting around"".Isn't it right that they left the decision to the judiciary?",1,1
"So the compensation should have been at least a billion dollars.It's halfway.There are people who will complain anyway, so even 1 billion or 10 billion is cheap.In fact, in Japan, there is no such thing as a verdict at face value.",1,1
"＞Sales decline is also due to competitive factorsIf that's the case, why don't you compare the sales of your competitors and the entire conveyor-belt sushi industry? Are there any companies whose sales increased after PEROPERO?",1,1
"If you quit school, why don't you get a job at Sushiro?It would be like a show in a way, but wouldn't it be a win-win situation for both parties if you repay a little from your salary?",1,1
Why did you replace all the battles?The very fact that he asked such an outrageous question is a no-no for a defendant who should be charged with a crime and made to reflect on it.How could you ask such a question?,1,1
"I don't blame you for wanting to complain, but you planted the seeds, didn't you?You can't complain even if they overreact and do something you don't have to do.You should be very careful about the crime of overturning the very foundations of food safety in Japan.",1,1
"When he said he dropped out of high school, Sushiro's side would probably say, ""I don't know.If this perpetrator drops out of high school, does that restore the damage suffered by Sushiro?",1,1
"I think people who defend themselves do the same thing. They think, ""What if I get caught, what if this happens to me?"" and they make themselves less guilty before they get caught.",1,1
"I just don't want to pay for it...They say they are sorry, but when I hear things like this, I don't think they are 100% sure.Well, even if they reduce the amount, it's an amount of money that will be a stick in the mud for the rest of your life, so let's just give up.",1,1
My family didn't mind at all.But my mom's friends in the same apartment usually refrained because of this.I think there are a lot of fastidious moms who don't know what they're talking about.,1,1
I think it is good.The people I want to appeal to are also those of us who eat at Sushiro. I don't know why you enjoy doing something that people don't like. Please tell them exactly what they are guilty of.,1,1
"＞Why defend only the perpetrators?Defending"" is for the guilty party who is being accused and blamed.Since the victim is overwhelmingly in the wrong, there is no point in daring to defend the victim.In a criminal case, only the accused side has a lawyer.",1,1
"If he had been properly reverent, there would still be room for extenuating circumstances, but with a lame excuse. This would not be interpreted as proper remorse.",1,1
I hope Sushiro will take a firm stand. Opinions defending the boy are out of touch with the essence of the matter. Good luck to Sushiro!,1,1
"Days of reflection on the part of the boy?Spreading is unpredictable?Not your fault because you didn't spread it but someone else did?You spend your days reflecting on what you've done...while insinuating thatWhen you give this answer, you are not reflecting at all.",1,1
"&gt; I didn't think it would spread.&gt; I don't know why they replaced all the bottles.Ignorance is a terrible thing.Why do we have to learn?""I feel like part of the answer to that is right here.",1,1
"Sushiro's customer base has gone away, sales and stock prices are down, so Peropero and that should be considered separately.The fact that the stock price has dropped from 2021 to less than half at one point is self-inflicted, and will they continue to have the same disposition to blame others for everything?November-December 2021 Crab Decoy AdJune 2022 Sea urchin decoy adJuly 2022 Half-price draft beer decoy adAugust 2022 Forgery of bigeye tuna by species",1,1
The worst offenders in this case are those who spread the video on social networking sites.The people who spread the video should also be charged with this amount of damages.,1,1

"The sales may be difficult to prove, but the cost of the measures is clear and easy to claim.What kind of cut-off point will the boy's lawyer use?",1,1
"＞Why do they defend only the perpetrators?It is quite natural that the ""perpetrator boy"" should pay the ""equivalent of 67 million yen"" as compensation for the ""foolish act"" he committed.There is no doubt here.",1,1
"If you're going to say it's an impediment to a peaceful life, don't do it in the first place.I don't know what you're talking about.I thought Sushiro's response was excellent.",1,1
The fact that the video of my stupid act went viral was unexpected and embarrassing → I just shouldn't have done it.I had to drop out of high school because the video went viral → I just shouldn't have licked the soy sauce jug.All of this could have been solved by simply not doing it.,1,1
"You write that you are disappointed that they are charging this much money to a juvenile.If it were you, would you think it's okay because it's a juvenile?You're only saying that because you weren't involved.",1,1
"It doesn't matter if the juvenile has been socially sanctioned or not, we just leave it to the judiciary to decide as a law enforcement agency.",1,1
"In fact, I was hesitant to go there after seeing that video, and I think it is inevitable that many people would think so and sales would drop.Don't argue, just pay the compensation! I think.",1,1
"Food poisoning can be quite a problem, and I urge you to think carefully about what will happen if you neglect sanitation.",1,1
"I still think it is a cheap damage award. You have Sushiro to thank for that, but someone is probably airing it out. You can't live there if you do stupid things.",1,1
"The title of the article is ""Why defend only the perpetrators..."". This is surprising. When I read the article, I thought that there were many opinions in the world that defended the perpetrators, but that was not the case. What was the reporter trying to say?",1,1
I will no longer go to Sushiro or any other conveyor belt sushi restaurant because of this one incident.Sushiro employees also have their livelihoods at stake.I think the charge is reasonable.,1,1
"As a kaiten sushi lover, what the boy did is unforgivable.Apart from that, he should be made to pay for what he did.",1,1
"There should never be any nuisance.However, I wonder if the sluggish performance is not only due to competitive factors, but also contributed to by the company's own decoy advertisements that discourage consumer confidence. Rust from the body.",1,1
"Sushiro must have done more damage from the bait-and-switch ads they've been running over and over again, and they're going to make this boy pay for that.I'm going to make this boy pay for that in another case.",1,1
"If the spread was not intended, shouldn't the boy's side sue the influencer who spread it?",1,1
"How dare this lawyer come up with such a lame excuse, as the old saying goes, ""Even a thief has his reasons. What would the world be like if such an excuse were accepted? What would you say if you were a business owner and someone did the same thing to you?",1,1
"This kind of argument from the perpetrator is instructive, isn't it? I would have apologized to the perpetrator, but he/she refutes it. In that sense, it is the same as North Korea's argument.",1,1
"Rather, isn't that totally lenient?You should charge more for compensation.No, wait...If I did that, he might say, ""I'm a rookie with more than a hundred million dollars! I'm a rookie with over a hundred million dollars!",1,1
"> ""The boy has been sufficiently socially sanctioned.""In this manner of speaking.It seems that the sanction is still not enough. For the future of the industry, it is necessary to let him solve the problem more thoroughly.",1,1
"If you're not sorry, do it thoroughly.Let's charge them for the true amount of damages.The conduct was so malicious that it affected more than just the conveyor belt sushi industry.",1,1
I think not only Mr. Perokichi but also the person who filmed him is liable for compensation.Shouldn't we consider that taking a picture = being a part of the nuisance?Isn't it a friend's responsibility to stop it?,1,1
This is the reason why I don't go to Kaiten Sushi anymore. I hope that the punishment will be severe without being misled by the various voices in the public.,1,1
"At least, my family has stopped going to Kaiten Sushi after watching that video.I don't trust them anymore.When we eat sushi, we either go to a sushi restaurant that doesn't revolve or buy sushi from the supermarket.",1,1
Reflection has nothing to do with reductions.It is natural to be sorry. It is also natural to pay damages.Don't let it be a win-win situation.,1,1
"67 million yen... if I work like hell from now on.I can pay it back.I'm 35 years old.I have a 35-year mortgage of 40 million yen.Hang in there, hang in there.",1,1
"I don't know if the article is true or not, but I don't think the boy has a shred of argument to offer. He should just accept everything and apologize. He should be ashamed of himself.",1,1
"Why did they replace all the bottles, and why are sales down, partly due to competition?""This is the lawyer's argument, not the answer. It is up to the courts to provide the answers.",1,1
Can't my friend who was with me and took the video be charged with a crime?You took it for fun. You should also compensate the person who took the video and the person who spread it.,1,1
"I understand the penalty, but are the results of your company's many missteps being accounted for? Did you take pictures of everything you threw away? Did you really change it? I'm going to go take a look now.",1,1
For everyone to be able to eat out with peace of mindI want you to take responsibility so that your restaurant can operate safelyI want you to take responsibility.,1,1
"As everyone has said many times, damages are not punishment. It is to make up for the damage Sushiro has caused.",1,1
"If Sushiro were to take a lenient approach, it would be a bit frightening. It could be taken as an admission of this kind of behavior to some extent.",1,1
"This boy is the one who put the video on social media.You should sue them.If the video had not been uploaded in the first place, this would not have happened.If he hadn't uploaded the video in the first place, this wouldn't have happened.",1,1
"Without the fact that ""all the bottles have been replaced,"" uninvolved customers would not feel safe using the service.",1,1
"I don't know what you're talking about, but if you want to make that a point of contention, your opponent should be a famous influencer, not Sushiro.",1,1
"There is no way the boy can pay 67 million.It's your choice to claim it, but it will increase the cost of the lawsuit, and what's the point?",1,1
"I feel uncomfortable with the fact that users use the same bathtubs, chairs, and washbasins in their super public baths without any resistance, but they are nervous only about the sanitation of conveyor-belt sushi.",1,1
"People don't normally lick bottles, whether they spread it on social media or not.If you didn't do such a thing in the first place, there wouldn't be such a fuss.Give up and pay the compensation.",1,1
"It would be good to have different opinions. If you only get one side of an opinion, that would be worse. In the press or on social networking sites.",1,1
"The cost of your jokey and funny act was huge.It can't be a joke anymore, and you should spend the rest of your life making amends... No, don't run away, make amends.",1,1
"Only lawyers who ask ""why did you replace all the bottles?"" demand that the food company or factory that contaminated the bottles recall and destroy all the bottles.",1,1
"I really don't know if I'm going to make it up,I feel like I should work at Sushiro to pay back the compensation. If you're going to atone for your sins, I️.",1,1
"When you consider the advertising effects, etc., and the impression it has made...I think that 67 million yen is not enough to cover the cost. It's more like a kindness on the part of the company.",1,1
"It doesn't matter if it's going to spread or not. If it doesn't get spread, is it ok to do it?Expulsion from high school didn't mean Sushiro spread the video and got expelled, did it?",1,1
The idea that it is excessive or socially sanctioned is subjective to others who are not the parties involved and are not hurt or itchy.,1,1
"&gt; On the other hand, he also states that he has no intention of ""sharing"" this ""nuisance"" with many people via the Internet and that he ""does not expect it to spread"".This excuse is unreasonable after posting it on a social networking service.",1,1
"I know it's a long way from the article, but it's strange that there are quite a few people who say ""my favorite food is sushi"" while saying ""I absolutely can't eat onigiri made by others.Both are made by other people.",1,1
"In any case, it would have been difficult to get the full amount, so I would have been happy to claim 16 billion yen for compensation at once.",1,1
"He is very sorry, but his future is doomed,I think the amount is reasonable as a deterrent to future copycats, but the actual amount is about one-third of what it should be because of the lack of precedent.",1,1
"He knew he was being filmed and did something annoying, and it was posted on the Internet.Since he knew he was being filmed and did the disturbing act, it is only natural that he is worse than someone who hides!",1,1
"This criminal is too much of a joke. I still think he should be covered with a very high compensation, just to make an example of him.",1,1
The reason you feel sorry for them is because you are worried about your own relatives. The number of consumers who have stopped going to conveyor-belt sushi restaurants is more than you can imagine.,1,1
It's like losing one key to something and having to replace the locks on the entire building.It would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to replace it.,1,1
"""All""? Is it?There are opinions like that, but...I think there are more people defending Sushiro than usual.In factIt's headlines like thatI think those headlines are the ones that are inciting the perpetratorsI think that's what's inciting people to criticize the perpetrators more and more.",1,1
"For reparations, for lessons for later life,Couldn't we make a ""movie"" about it?I hope they will think positively about it.",1,1
Perhaps the company has been too kind in the past.I wondered if the boy would be able to forgive the same thing if he were to become a manager someday.I thought.,1,1
It would mean that the boy's actions are not directly related to the impact on Sushiro's management or customers. ← I wonder what kind of thinking would lead to this kind of thinking.,1,1
"I stopped going to the chain restaurants.I stopped going to chain restaurants. I just went to the counter.So, my family lost two or three million dollars per meal, and we became poor.I'm not going to a chain restaurant for a while.",1,1

"This boy, of course, but is there any responsibility on the part of the person who took the video?He didn't seem to stop, he just laughed and took the video, and I think he's just as guilty.",1,1
"I find it more unacceptable, like the alternative fish issue at the conveyor belt sushi restaurants.This would be an act that would constitute damages to the customer.",1,1
All you had to do was not cause trouble in the first place.It doesn't matter if you don't spread the word or not.I don't think you're truly sorry for what you did.,1,1
"Is the perpetrator's lawyer going to defend him?If you argue like this, you're sure to get a bad impression.Or is he not interested in defending the case, or is he a bad guy who would seriously say something like this?or is he a dangerous guy who would seriously say something like this?",1,1
You just don't have to do the annoying thing in the first place.Didn't you learn from your parents or school that you shouldn't bother people?,1,1
"For or against ____! The problem is the media that picks up the voices of one or two people in a million and makes a fuss about it.The problem is the mass media that picks up one or two people in a million and makes a fuss.

"If sales decrease, Sushiro's shareholders will be outraged! If the company doesn't pay for the damages, the entire board of directors will be blamed at the shareholders meeting!",1,1
The juvenile's side of the story doesn't mean that the juvenile's family said it. The juvenile's lawyer is just making the argument in court.,1,1

"Why do you think it's a measure to avoid being pranked?Don't get pranked and don't bother others!That's probably where it starts.You're doing it on purpose, so any countermeasures would be useless.",1,1
That's how much trouble they've caused the world.Sushiro did nothing wrong.I don't think any amount of screaming will change anything.,1,1
"Confession.The other day, when we decided to eat out as a family, kaiten-zushi was not on the table. We used to go to kaiten-zushi all the time.I think that's how it is.",1,1

"You're not aware enough to realize that you've affected not only Sushiro, but all restaurants that have condiments on their counters.",1,1

"If you have to replace the soy sauce jug, you will end up in a situation where you have to replace it because of complaints from customers, won't you?",1,1
"I'm sure the lawyers put them there, but that kind of response makes the victims less inclined to settle.",1,1
The limiting factor that revolving restaurants must face is the sanitation of the food they serve. Blame it on some pranksters. ......,1,1

"No need for consideration!!!! Social sanctions will be triggered after the ""only remorse"" trial is over.It should serve as a model of admonition.",1,1
"I'm really getting sick of it.The usual media. The tone as if to make it impossible to tell who is the perpetrator and who is the victim. The tone is as if the perpetrator and the victim are reversed before you know it. Finally, they make it seem as if neither side is the aggressor or the victim, and then they make it all go away. Don't get in the way of Japan! The media!",1,1

You say many things, but you don't say them! I feel like.",1,1
Are we supposed to defend only the perpetrators?My first impression is that there are few opinions defending the perpetrators...,1,1
I think punishment and compensation are two different things. Punishment is punishment. Reparations are reparations. I think you are mixing them up.,1,1
There's no way an individual can afford the social sanctions for a case of this magnitude.The amount of money is so small that it's not even worth it.,1,1

"I want Sushiro to settle out of court thoroughly, without compromise or settlement.",1,1

Will the first person in the world to commit a crime with a knife be responsible for preventing its recurrence?,1,1
"I think it's natural to take measures and dispose of the waste at the stores in question, but not for all stores.",1,1
"They are firm litigants for their own damages, so Sushiro deserves to be compensated for deceiving its customers with hype.",1,1
"Maybe it's a lawyer's trick, but by making this comment, you make it even worse.As the saying goes, ""If all you had to do was say you were sorry, there would be no need for the police.",1,1
Just think of replacing soy sauce with a car and you will be convinced.Replacing some defects with all defects.,1,1

He's still a high school student.He'll be an adult in a little while. You can't treat him like an elementary school student.,1,1
Sushiro is being nice.They should charge these jokers at the price of the falling stock price.,1,1
The Twitter influencers and others who spread the word are responsible. I wish I could get compensation from that person who gained from the buzz.,1,1
"Not necessarily all of what the video did; if there's even a 1% chance, I'll replace it all. It's disgusting.",1,1

"Sushiro is not a charity either, so there is no reason to defend the perpetrators.Human rights lawyers spring up everywhere.",1,1
You can't just argue with me and be taken to mean that you're not sorry at all.You have to show that you're sorry.,1,1

"If you want to advocate, just shoulder part of the compensation.A mealy-mouthed advocacy is not advocacy.It is an irresponsible statement.",1,1
I also wonder why Sushiro didn't do anything about this kind of problem that has existed for so long.,1,1

"In the face of competition, a video like that is more than enough of a competitive factor.",1,1
"It is so typical of Japan that just because the person who did something like this refutes it, they say, ""It's inexcusable because they don't feel remorse.",1,1
"First of allIt was a mistake when the video was uploaded. ""was a mistake"" isis not acceptable.There are many people who understand the prank.",1,1
"It is no shock that the juvenile side would make this objection. It was natural and predictable. The title is too incendiary.Not very nice, Yahoo.",1,1
Is the boy the only person involved (the perpetrator)?What about the people who were with him (the people who were filming?)? What about the people who were with him (the people who were filming)?,1,1

"Daily reflections are pointless if the store can't figure out ""why all the bottles were replaced"".",1,1
"The lawyers on Sushipero's side must be complete amateurs who have never tried a civil trial before, right?There's no social sanctions involved in a civil trial.",1,1
"It's no wonder that I can't sympathize with them, since it's an excuse that the lawyers worked hard to cobble together in a situation that was originally unfavorable to them.",1,1

"The spread of the video is unexpected, which is a huge problem with the act in the first place.It is not remorseful at all!",1,1
Only when the people who were offended by that video are convinced (and forgive) will they be socially sanctioned.,1,1
Why don't the boy's side sue the influencer this time along with that claim?,1,1
"You quit high school on your own.You weren't expelled, and I'd like to ask you why you did it.",1,1
I would like to suggest that Sushiro should sue against the opinions of those who support the juvenile. As an enemy of restaurants.,1,1
"These people don't say they're sorry, they just feel regret and are extremely depressed.From the other side, they just look like they're sorry.",1,1
The court's decision is a matter of concern in order to reduce copycat crimes.,1,1

"You are 17 years old. Almost an adult, so right or wrong... but?Where is your life going to be affected by the blackout job, etc.?Good sex and bad sex, huh?",1,1
The problem is that I can't imagine what would happen if I did that before I could argue with them.,1,1
"Maybe I don't feel sorry for myself.Even I, in Osaka, don't go to Sushiro, but to Kura Sushi, which is spinning in a capsule.",1,1
I want Sushiro to be thorough.I'm rooting for you.,1,1
"From a customer's perspective, it's a relief to hear that everything has been replaced.",1,1
It looks like he has no remorse at all.It seems to me that even stricter punishment is necessary.,1,1
"I don't mind, but I certainly haven't been to Sushiro since I saw that video.",1,1
"Even if you punish them severely, the same people will come out. Because they don't watch the news, and when they do, they don't have the ability to learn.",1,1
I am not sorry at all! You should calculate more finely and claim all the compensation!,1,1
"I don't understand why people criticize Sushiro.If you were in business and something like that happened to you, would you feel that way?",1,1
My honest impression is that you shouldn't rattle on after causing trouble for the company and the entire conveyor-belt sushi company.,1,1
"I live in an area where there is no Sushiro, but after this one incident, I stopped going to Kaitenzushi for a while.",1,1
I'm sure the decline in sales is due in part to price increases due to various price hikes.,1,1

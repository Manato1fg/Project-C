"It is a very low price offer. As for the actual damage done to the company, it is an incalculable loss in terms of falling credibility and destroying the credibility of the conveyor-belt sushi system, and by extension, the nationalistic and hygienic image of Japan. They will probably go bankrupt anyway, but I'm sure they don't think that much of it. I think it would be cheap to charge them 200 million yen considering the social impact.",11143,362
"Although the emphasis tends to be on the amount of money involved, we hope that as much as possible, ""the person himself/herself will pay compensation directly to the victim. Although it is realistic for the parents to pay the money on behalf of the victim, the ""return of the money to the parents"" diminishes the feelings of remorse. It would be better to ""pay the victim yourself,"" even if it takes many years, so that the feelings of remorse would not be diminished so much. Therefore, if we are truly concerned about the life of the offender, it is more important to ""give him more time"" than to ""lower the amount of money. Ideally, the perpetrator should be told to ""take 50 years and continue to pay 100,000 yen per month directly to the offender once he or she has entered the workforce. However, this is only a theoretical idealism, considering the fact that a case would greatly affect the chances of getting a job.",100,23
"This article is a valid point. When looking at juvenile crimes, the victims are left behind, saying that they are minors and that rehabilitation is important. I think there is no coverage from the victims' point of view. In other countries, the amount of damages is calculated based on the amount of loss, regardless of whether the victim can pay or not. I think that Japanese courts are more like to calculate the amount of reduction from the standpoint of the payer. I don't think that the 67 million yen awarded to Sushiro is a very high amount of damages, in fact, I think it is a very small amount.",8055,152
"It will be an opportunity to spread the word about what it means to cause trouble for a company and spread the word on social networking sites. A certain Nisei (second-generation) celebrity said that he should make them do backstage work to compensate for their actions, but if that is the extent to which they are allowed to do so, there will be no decrease in the number of victims. Of course, education should be provided at home, but as long as there is no age limit on the possession of smartphones, IT literacy education, including SNS operation, should be provided in compulsory education.",324,7
"Holding companies and society accountable is an effective way to reduce similar acts. The TV and other media outlets have made off-topic comments such as ""moral education in schools...,"" but such people do not listen to teachers, and children who can listen to lessons with a firm attitude do not cause such incidents. The recent rash of robberies also need to be reported and companies that have suffered damage need to file lawsuits to make people aware of the possibility of success and the seriousness of getting caught, and to discourage them from doing so. The only thing that should be taught in schools is the fact that ""you will carry a heavy burden for the rest of your life because of your rash actions,"" but unfortunately, this advice is not being heeded by the children.",865,16
"It was recently reported that a 19-year-old boy was arrested for robbery and assault for the seventh time on the same charge. If there were room for sympathy, we would be inclined to ""consider the future of the perpetrator boy,"" but clearly there are those who are taking advantage of this situation and committing the crime. From now on, shouldn't we be thinking in terms of preventing recurrence and similar crimes, rather than in terms of the perpetrator's future?",5155,54
"I feel that the argument in defense of the perpetrator is only to the point of not caring. I don't think this case involves ""human rights"" in particular, and I don't think it is an infringement of the perpetrator's character. I think it's true that the scale is different in other countries, but I don't think they were influenced by the media to come up with the 67 million yen figure. I think it is possible to bemoan the difference between Japan and other countries based on how much liability is recognized in the court.",31,3
"To be honest, I have always been a prankster. People know it's wrong, but they think it's funny and show it to everyone. Nowadays, there are many young people who don't understand what it means to post something on social networking sites. I am grateful for Sushiro's lawsuit to make people aware of this. It is necessary for the people who work hard at Sushiro to be able to eat out safely and securely.",2956,48
"The actual damages suffered must be much greater. But I don't think the assailant has the ability to pay the bill for hundreds of millions of dollars. The cost of litigation will only become more expensive. On the other hand, although it is not an example, I think it is necessary to let the public know that damages will be claimed in order to prevent such pranks and shenanigans. Then, it might be appropriate to charge this amount of money.",2448,73
"I think Sushiro would normally be lukewarm about the amount of this bill. The lives of the employees and their families are at stake, and if the company becomes a major player, the impact will be much greater. I think that the claim for damages against the boy is a good way to show that companies will have to pay a large price if they cause damage through malicious and disruptive behavior, and that this will have a certain effect in deterring imitations, which I think is a natural step. It would be better for the boy's future if he and his guardians reflect on their actions in the true sense of the word.",1887,39
"In the first place, it is wrong to cover up for the perpetrator. Not only does it encourage criminal behavior, but it can also, on the contrary, drive the victim away. The perpetrator is the perpetrator. It is the right thing for a nation governed by the rule of law to hold perpetrators accountable both criminally and civilly in accordance with the law.",1889,34
"The stock price was plummeting and the damage caused was probably more than this amount, so I think there were many things that could have been done, such as reviewing all stores and replacing equipment. I think you should know that this is not just a prank, but a crime.",393,14
"There can be no blame because they are minors. A young child who cannot judge right from wrong should be old enough to understand that he or she should not cause trouble to others or to society, including the education of his or her parents. It is outrageous to do it even if you know what you are doing. Is it that you protect the perpetrators and don't care about the victims? The perpetrator should pay for his crime even if he is a minor, and the victim should be compensated for the damage. It doesn't matter how many years it takes, this boy and his friends who took the video should also be made to pay for their crimes. I hope that such a ridiculous video will never be followed up again.",1207,24
"The unsolicited videos are beyond notice. No matter how much the perpetrator is charged, it is not surprising considering the loss to the victim. Moreover, the perpetrator claims that the store has not suffered that much loss. It may be a legal technique, but I don't think he is very remorseful. In order to prevent such damage from occurring in the future, I think the situation should be dealt with strictly. It should be kept in mind that the amount of compensation claimed is often far from the amount of compensation actually awarded by the judiciary.",937,19
"The boy should be sued, but the person who filmed the video is probably just as guilty. The problem with the copyright of the reprinting of the summary site was also a problem, but the management side should also bear the responsibility. Especially when it comes to corporate compensation, it is not something that can be paid by an individual.",1046,113
"Since this incident, the restaurant industry has had to take various measures. Who is paying for the AI cameras, the changes in the serving system, etc.? The liberal loons who defend the perpetrators have no regard for the cost as long as they are not paying for it themselves. The companies are bearing the cost and their employees' salaries and bonuses may have been affected. If you expect them to be rehabilitated, it is better to make them realize the folly they have committed than to coddle them by defending them. If you expect rehabilitation, it is better to make them realize the folly they have committed than to defend and coddle them. Without that, it will be nothing more than a black history or a saga.",609,22
"It would be more damaging to be offered a realistic amount of tens of millions of yen than to be offered a tremendous amount of money, about a billion yen, that I could not pay even if I spent my whole life. At the very least, they'd have to bear the cost of capital investment (replacement of small items, installation of acrylic panels, etc.). That's hundreds of stores, so I'm sure a reasonable amount would be approved. That's a level of compensation that would take a lifetime. Good luck.",369,14
"I don't watch TV...but when I think of former baseball personalities, they immediately come to mind. I have to admit that I am angry at this comment! It's a scurrilous opinion that doesn't even understand the importance of menial labor (I don't think this expression is good either), especially in a restaurant! This is coming from someone who doesn't understand how much hard work and responsibility it entails! As this person says, overseas, the lawsuits will probably be in the billions and billions of yen! I personally think that he has done that much...he should pay for the rest of his life! And when the victims think they are truly rehabilitated, they should take the appropriate measures!",629,15
"I think 67 million yen is a very compromised amount. If they do not accept this amount and appeal the judgment, I think it would be better to claim the full amount of damages instead of the compromised amount, seeing that they have no intention of showing remorse. The perpetrator may think it is a large amount of compensation, but if they don't take action while they are compromising, the wounds will continue to widen.",463,13
"Most people understand that personal values differ from person to person. Therefore, in the case of the recent incident, personal values are reflected in the bad guys who committed the nuisance act, and they are inevitably divided into those who defend, criticize, and those who are neither. In today's world, those who defend the bad guys are naturally in the minority. The same is inevitably true for good people, and those who criticize will be in the minority. My value system is that the compensation is too small. I understand that there are people who think that the amount should be reduced because the boy is a juvenile, he is a prankster, he is sorry, and he is pathetic, but I do not agree with them.",318,15
"I was born after the war, but when I was young most people were poor. They were not allowed to buy what they wanted and were content with a small allowance per day. By the time I started working, the country was on the threshold of rapid economic growth, and young people had dreams. There were many things I wanted to buy with my work. Above all, they understood the importance of money. Today's young people have parents who give them what they want. They could play games and other games from an early age. Considering this, I have recently come to think that while the Japanese people have gained wealth, they have neglected something.",433,84
"In the first place, it is wrong to let Nagashima's son handle such a social issue. He is equating social issues with entertainment. Whenever you express your opinion as a comment on the public airwaves, it always has an impact. Do you understand the weight of that responsibility?",828,18
"The dishes are put in the washer. All you have to do is line up the dishes and pull down the lever. And it's considerably faster than a home dishwasher. It's not a punishment of any kind. If you want to do it, you don't have to get involved in the restaurant, just volunteer to pull weeds in the park or clean public toilets. I feel sorry for the amount of compensation for what they did, but it would be effective in terms of giving both parents and children a hard time to prevent copycats. There was a similar video broadcast after that, wasn't there? I'm sorry, but you need to install security cameras in the store, and if any wrongdoing is discovered, it should be saved and immediately discussed with the police. I would be especially wary of groups. The more people there are, the worse their manners are.",575,168
"As for the stock price, it is true that the stock price plummeted immediately after the disturbance, but it recovered sharply the next day and is now at an even higher price. Furthermore, Sushiro did not sell its shares at the time of the decline, and did not record a loss, but rather held on to them, so it is merely a part of the daily fluctuation of the stock price at market value. A claim of 67 million yen for damages against an individual, and against a minor, is impactful enough, and the Sushiro side seems unrelenting. Sushiro's resolute response deserves our support from the standpoint of acting as a deterrent.",240,25
"Sushiro's offer is quite considerate to the offender, as this article shows. In fact, compared to the damage Sushiro has suffered, I think the amount claimed is an order of magnitude or two different. I think they should have charged the most in order to prevent such crimes and amusement in the future. However, I am not sure if I can actually pay the bill. But I think it will be a deterrent to crime.",84,2
"I think that rehabilitation is important and compensation is a separate issue. Rehabilitation is how to consider it as a criminal penalty, and compensation is a civil matter of how to compensate for actual damages. The culprit and the parents should show that they can't pay that much, but they will pay the possible amount little by little in the future, and it could influence them to consider rehabilitation. That one where the presence or absence of a settlement affects the punishment.",32,2
"Am I the only one who feels that the modus operandi has become more insidious than in the past? Children who were raised strictly become parents and become lenient because they don't want to put their children through that kind of experience. I don't know how you feel, but there is a difference between discipline and coddling. The role of parents is to teach their children what is wrong and what is good until they understand what is right. It is no wonder that people who don't understand that the environment in which they grow up greatly influences their children's future become parents, but I think that people who are raised strictly have more guts and are better able to judge right from wrong. I don't know how to feel sorry for them at all because of their children's future. The tendency to protect the perpetrators is not good. It is good to protect them by law, but it is wrong as an individual feeling. Peacefulness is also painful when it goes so far.",151,8
"Even a young boy should be capable of judging the rightness or wrongness of what he is doing. If he did it through his own efforts, he cannot escape responsibility, no matter how much he tries to excuse himself. If the victim is a large chain store, the damage and the amount of damage will be enormous. It is a natural right to claim compensation for such damage. The 67 million yen damages claim is a low figure, and anyone can see that. I think that the amount of the claim is set low for those who have suffered damage, taking into consideration the image and operation of the restaurant thereafter.",13,2
"I often go to Sushiro and Tsuya, but in recent years they have started to use small bags of wasabi and mustard. It's a huge hassle. I think it is not only a hassle, but also not environmentally friendly, and the food loss that remains in the sachets is a serious problem. I think we should think carefully about how much impact our actions, which may have been just a little bit of a joke, have had on society and, by extension, on the global environment, and punish them accordingly. Personally, I would like them to pay about one trillion yen, but I think they should be made to pay at least 100 million yen if they can pay it over the course of their lifetime.",112,7
"I think this compensation claim is quite inexpensive. I think there are many restaurants, including Sushiro, that have invested a good amount of money in food safety. The fact that they have done so in the blink of an eye, and with such a careless heart, is a crime. I don't think any argument will pass muster. First of all, the parents should be held responsible for compensation and the rehabilitation of the offender. I think it is best for the outside world to watch over him without saying a word.",29,2
"From the perspective of the country of Japan, this would be an expensive claim for damages. However, we do not know how much money will be awarded in a court case in light of past precedents. In reality, it is unlikely to be that high. Moreover, even if a higher amount is awarded, the defendants will probably go bankrupt, so the plaintiff companies may not expect to receive the money. Rather, we can only assume that the companies are trying to create a deterrent effect on society by charging a higher amount.",21,2
"I thought it was a wonder that it did not exceed 100 million. I don't know how much the stock price has recovered from the decline at the time of the incident, but I imagine that the shareholders and people who were buying on margin (or cutting their losses, depending on who you ask) at the time must have been very upset. I think it must have been a terrible time for the shareholders and people who were buying on margin (or cutting their losses/losses, depending on the person) at the time. The public health issue at Corona didn't help, and it also undermined the efforts of the restaurant. I don't want people like this washing dishes, and I doubt if the food is brought in and stored properly. They think it's okay because they are minors, or that the future of minors is at stake, but they remain naive, which is why even minor incidents continue to happen. I also wonder if the perpetrators are given equal footing with the victims, and I feel as if the perpetrator wins. It's not right that victims compromise, or that it only encourages crime. The sentence is given because they don't know. If they know, they won't be sentenced. That's all there is to it.",55,4
"I think the current situation in Japan is that crime among young people is increasing. I feel that this is due to the law's too weak deterrent power and the collapse of education. It would be understandable if there was no need to defend the perpetrators, but only to punish them appropriately and give them a way to rehabilitate themselves afterwards. I think it is necessary to strengthen the position of teachers who educate young people and to develop new methods of education to foster good human beings. Laws and politics need to be reformed to match the modern world.",26,6
"If this were a self-employed store, it would have gone out of business, or worse, the whole family would have been destroyed, and if the guy who did this is at fault, why are you trying to lessen your responsibility? It's up to the victim to decide what to do, and we're not charging an outrageous amount in terms of the actual damage. There are things that are right and wrong, and they should be held accountable.",327,9
"In fact, in these industries, dishwashing is done by ""automatic dishwashers"" rather than by human hands. There is almost no work that this boy can do. And another practical thing is that the company does not expect to be able to pay the boy 67 million yen plus other expenses. It may be a punitive measure to prevent copycats from committing the same crime. The shareholders will not remain silent about the huge loss of 16 billion yen in stock. Apart from the boy's crime and apology, the responsibility of the company to its shareholders is also being questioned. It means that the incident has become so big that it can no longer be backtracked.",17,2
"In a restaurant, it is truly a professional job to know how to bring in the ingredients (quickly to keep them fresh, carefully to avoid damage, and easily accessible so that customers can see where they are at peak times...). This is even more important in a sushi restaurant that handles fresh food. Washing dishes is also hard work. It is such an important job that hygiene inspections check for residual bacteria on trays after washing. It is not a half-hearted job.",48,1
"I don't like Sushiro at all, as Sushiro itself is a pretty shady business, but this incident has definitely had a significant negative impact on other conveyor-belt sushi chains and restaurants, and they should be compensated for their losses. No matter how underage he is, the idea that led to this act in the first place is extraordinary, and this incident should be a deterrent to other people doing the same kind of thing. Some people are naive enough to say that they should be compensated by having them work at the site, but the sites that take on such cases are not happy because it would only increase the amount of unnecessary work. Work is not volunteer work. They should be made to pay for their losses.",9,1
"I think it is only natural that a lawsuit should be filed between Sushiro and the juvenile, and there is no need to consider whether the juvenile is a minor or not. However, this is a matter between Sushiro and the boy, and I think people are making too much fuss about it. Sushiro is not a high class restaurant. There is plenty of room for this kind of thing to happen, and if you really want a hygienic restaurant, you should go to an expensive one. It is a good thing that Japan demands a high level of hygiene even in cheap restaurants, but it is also a burden on the restaurants and their cheap hourly employees.",11,47
"After this incident, there have been many copycats. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, Japanese society is too lenient these days, and I think this kind of people will come out. I think the whole society should be aware of the severity of the situation, even if it is not North Korea. I think it is necessary to spread the word to the entire society about what awaits them if they do such things.",12,5
"As someone who has worked in the restaurant business, I think this kind of response is appropriate, and I'd rather not have been able to do it before. There were adults who smoked in a non-smoking restaurant, people who came alone and were on line, and people who would only serve table-top condiments and not use them. The degree of the problem varies from person to person, and even if you warn them and make them stop right then and there, they will eventually do it again elsewhere. This time, information has been spread on the Internet and the company versus the boy has attracted public attention, but if possible, I would like the results of the trial to be made public. I hope that it will be an opportunity for society to know how much of a crime it is to do something lightly.",5,1
"It was reported that the stock price during this period (after the discovery of the problematic event) fell by 16 billion yen. Although the other side raised the issue of causality, it is a fact that the stock price fell during that period, and even in light of that, the company did not mention the 16 billion yen loss, but demanded 67 million yen in compensation for the loss, which I think is a result of the company's great consideration for the other side. In other countries where lawsuits are common, the company would have been sued for tens of billions of yen in addition to the loss of 16 billion yen in stock price, including compensation. Some in the media and others involved in the case are calling for the perpetrator's rehabilitation because he is a minor, but even if he is a minor, he should be punished for what he did, and I cannot understand the thinking of those involved in the case who are defending the perpetrator. The assailant is neither a ""toddler"" nor a ""lower grade elementary school student,"" and is old enough to understand right and wrong, and because he knew that, he acted only for the purpose of buzzing.",46,4
"Japan has always seemed to be a country that is kind to perpetrators and harsh to victims. This may be especially true when the perpetrator is a juvenile. Not only in this case, but also in stalking, violence, and even murder cases, there are people and media who put strange pressure on the victim in the name of encouraging the rehabilitation of the perpetrator. Helping to rehabilitate the victim should be done as early as possible, when the victim has begun to compensate the other party under remorse. Victims have the right to file civil lawsuits. The problem is that some people do not even understand this, especially commentators in the media.",11,2
"I disagree with the opinion of so-called liberals that juveniles should be protected and sheltered and considered a possibility for rehabilitation. I even think that the existence of the Juvenile Law hinders the rehabilitation of juveniles. 15-year-olds can judge the right and wrong of most things. They are aware that they will be punished if they do wrong. I think that the juvenile law, which is a bad law, eliminates or lightens the punishment, so that juveniles can be aware that it is no big deal if they do something bad. To go a little off topic, I think that Japanese criminal law is too lenient across the board. The amount of punishment is too lenient in relation to the impact suffered by the victim. For example, crimes such as methamphetamine ruin the lives of many people and even take their lives. Yet, they do not carry the death penalty or even life in prison. If a person is charged with a methamphetamine crime and given a life sentence, the majority of people will not get involved. Since methamphetamine brings no benefit, I think it is good that the punishment is as severe as it is.",17,4
"I'm not saying that you have to put yourself in that position, but I can imagine that there are a lot of people who are involved in that kind of work. It doesn't matter if you're a minor or not. I'm not saying that I'd put myself in that position, but I can imagine that there are a lot of people out there who would be in that position.",20,1
"Japan does not have the concept of punitive damages as in the United States. The calculation of the amount of damages claimed is based on the causal relationship. First, a direct causal relationship is recognized for damages for disinfection work, compensation for absence from work, and loss of credibility of the affected store. The actual cost of the disinfection work and a reasonable amount of compensation for absence from work and loss of credibility will be awarded in light of past sales performance. On the other hand, not all of the effects on stock market capitalization and other store sales can be said to have a direct causal relationship. However, some of them will be recognized as having been affected by Sushipero and will be reflected in the amount of compensation for damages.",6,1
"I don't think the person who said ""let him do the dishes"" is trying to say that the victim should be rehabilitated. 67 million yen is a small amount for the damages, because the victim probably didn't file the lawsuit just for the loss of the damage, and I think this amount of money is just a drop in the bucket. I think the lawsuit was filed with the hope that this kind of thing will not happen in the future. So I think I was just saying that they should do the dishes so that they would know how hard it is for them in the future. It would be nice to let everyone who might do something like that know how hard it is to work in a restaurant, but that's not possible. But just because I washed dishes doesn't mean I know how hard it is to work in a restaurant. I think this person just couldn't think of anything else to do but wash dishes because he is not a restaurant person either.",12,41
"I am involved in work confronting juvenile crime, and very few of them are truly remorseful. The postwar period, when it was difficult to live without committing crimes, was probably the time when rehabilitation and sound upbringing were the goal. The biggest reason why juveniles do not reflect on their crimes is the Juvenile Law. In this case, there is no room for sympathy at all, considering that he did it of his own volition, not because he was forced to do it by anyone. And, moreover, isn't there even a need to defend them? I hope that the Juvenile Law will be drastically revised or abolished.",16,3
"I think the figure of 67 million is the amount of money that Sushiro thought through, which this boy could pay back by working as hard as he could for the rest of his life. I think the figure calculated from the actual damage is much higher. Some may say that it is cruel to force a young man to pay a fine that will last a lifetime, but Sushiro is the one who has suffered an unreasonable damage, and they have to protect the lives of their employees. I think that the perpetrating juvenile should be asked to atone for the crime he committed, with his whole life.",6,3
"Not only in this case, but in Japan, there is too much protection for the perpetrators. It's about privacy protection, rehabilitation, etc. Priority should be given to compensating the victim for damages that are not only financial, but also unknowable. This will deter crime in the long run.",11,3
"In Japan, lawyers themselves are often encouraged and discouraged when they try to file a claim for punitive damages, perhaps because of the horizontal nature of the legal profession. It is highly likely that Japan is no longer a society in which good intentions are accepted, and we need to send a message that we will take decisive action against tortious behavior by filing a claim for punitive damages.",88,4
"I thought it was cheap too. I know that the news probably made some people avoid conveyor-belt sushi, and they had to make it more elaborate by installing condiments and tableware that used to be stationary, after customers were seated. I thought it would be more expensive considering the magnitude of the impact. I think this amount of money is pretty warm and fuzzy, though!",4,2
"I am also in favor of the compensation for Mr. Sushiro, as I consider myself a country that is soft on perpetrators. Although we say that the juvenile should be rehabilitated, compensation for the damages is justified because this incident could increase the hardships of those who work in the field and cause them to lose their jobs. I hope this will be a deterrent to such incidents in the future.",52,4
"I certainly feel uncomfortable with the perpetrator's advocacy on this matter. I almost agree with the reporter who wrote the article. I also feel that this is the cause of what is wrong with Japan these days. I think that the only way to deal with this kind of thing is to make the child and his/her parents feel responsible for it. I also hope that families, schools, and the media will educate and enlighten people about how stupid and disgraceful it is to show off one's ""umashi"" on social networking sites, and how it is not good for the child, society, or even for entertainment. I hope that families and schools, as well as the media, will educate and enlighten people about it.",24,1
"At most, the perpetrator can be considered a minor until before entering junior high school. A healthy child will be able to judge right from wrong by the time he or she reaches the upper grades. Even if they have intellectual or developmental disabilities, they will understand what not to do by the time they graduate from elementary school if they are properly taught by their parents or schools (ASD in particular are often obsessed with following rules). On the other hand, some intelligent types think that if they are going to try something bad, they should do it while they are still minors. The perpetrator in this case at Sushiro is in his late teens, and I think it's only right that a punishment similar to that of an adult was considered. In a world that values diversity, the tendency to protect the perpetrators of bullying, etc., should be eliminated.",9,2
"The victim Sushiro would probably want to claim all the costs incurred by all the stores and the profits lost due to lost opportunities, but the company should take care of this kind of thing.  I'm not sure if the article is based on the assumption that only the person who did it will pay, but I think all of the people who were there when the video was taken should be held equally responsible.",4,1
"Some say that 67 million is too much, but I think it is a reasonable amount to show that there will be no more mock crimes and that the victims are serious about this. In fact, the victims are still implementing countermeasures and have said that they will add more money to the amount. In addition, the victims are not only the management, but also the employees (including managers and executives) and shareholders. Some of the employees may have quit because of the incident (conversely, they may still be working there if the incident had not occurred). In reality, however, it is also true that the full amount requested by the victim is rarely granted. So I think the focus from now on will be on how far the judiciary can stand by the victim (the store side). Considering the seriousness of what the perpetrator did (stock prices plummeted, customers lost business due to the incident, etc.) and the degree of remorse (he seems to have apologized, but his lawyers are fighting the case), will they accept the full amount plus an additional amount, or will they consider social sanctions and reduce the amount?",7,1
"No, the boy does not have to bear that much responsibility for the stock price and sanitation problems, because the management system is responsible for those problems. The decline in the stock price is the result of investors deciding that they cannot invest in a company where sanitary problems occur so easily, which is a completely different story from the boy's responsibility. Also, those who spread the word and those who participated in the flames by rejecting the product are also to blame. It is not a matter of a lawsuit by the company, and a settlement between the store, the boy, and his parents or guardians would be sufficient. Moreover, to allow this claim to stand would be to invoke an excessive sense of guilt for a mistake made by an immature person with a light heart, which would further accelerate the decline in the birthrate.",4,18
"I think the low amount of money is a deliberate aim. If the amount is too high, the family will give up and not be able to collect even a penny, and even when considering the deterrent effect on others, it will seem otherworldly and unrealistic. Or maybe even lower, but as a punishment for an average family, the damage seems more severe as there seems to be no way to get away with it.",4,1
"You're forgetting that this was an act that could have resulted in food poisoning. If that had happened, the restaurant would have been held responsible for the unexplained food poisoning, the media would have beaten them up, and the restaurant could have been closed. The perpetrators may be going bankrupt with claims for compensation, but before you start feeling sorry for them or defending them, you should consider how much of a risk they were to the victims.",3,3
"In the U.S., the court would order compensation as per the amount claimed, but the Japanese court would limit it to the amount that can be compensated. 30 million yen would be appropriate, and although it is possible for a minor to go bankrupt, it is not possible to get even since the compensation is for his/her own malicious intent. It is not decided that only the person himself should be compensated, so parents and relatives should be able to manage if they shoulder the burden.",19,2
"If you consider a 16 billion yen drop in stock prices, I think 1.6 billion yen is appropriate considering the social impact... I think 67 million yen is quite reasonable. I think there should be social sanctions to prevent copycats in the future.",10,3
"I have a lot of love for this compensation claim amount set. I think the actual amount of damage on Sushiro's side would be in the hundreds of millions if they were to make a proper claim, but I think the amount is set exquisitely for the possibility of payment by the perpetrator's family and for the effect of sending out a message to society. In fact, I'm sure they would like to charge more. It was well considered, and I took the president's comments as a good, open and honest company.",7,2
"The premise that should be taken into consideration is that the lawsuit brought by Sushiro is a ""civil"" lawsuit. In a civil lawsuit, the court should judge the perpetrator, the victim, the amount of damages, and the amount of compensation in accordance with the Civil Code.",23,2
"Perhaps Sushiro's claim for compensation is not so much against the perpetrator boy, but more for the purpose of showing the public that ""we will claim this level of compensation if we are inconvenienced in this way""? That would be an amount that is not at all lenient, but also not so harsh as to be indiscriminately harsh. It is hopeless for an average family to come up with 67 million yen, and it would be impossible for an individual boy (the liability is basically only for the boy himself). If it is impossible, it could end up being almost impossible to pay. On the other hand, if the amount changes in court and settles on a realistic several hundred thousand yen to two million yen, will the public recognize that the parents or someone close to them paid on their shoulders, and with that the responsibility has been fulfilled? The employees and customers of the on-site store who were directly offended would not receive any compensation to be distributed later. While there may be a desire to punish them and let the situation cool down, I don't think that high compensation is the best way to do so, and Sushiro's goal may be different.",1,1
"Certainly rehabilitation is paramount. If the compensation is too high, Sushiro stores, headquarters, and executives may retaliate in the future if they cannot actually pay. That is why they set the amount at the limit of what they could pay if they tried hard enough. Continued payments will prevent them from severing ties with the company and allow them to ascertain to some extent whether the company is still alive or not. But why should Sushiro be so concerned about this?",20,2
"I think the first step is to make them pay for what they did before they are rehabilitated, even if they are minors. Without that, they can do whatever they want under the shade of a minor. They are not immature, they know that the punishment is much lighter for minors, and they know that the shade of a minor is the most powerful item, so they can do things that adults can't. Adults don't understand that about minors. Adults don't understand that about minors. So I personally think that even minors should be treated the same as adults in every way so that they can be punished severely. They just need to think about how they will be rehabilitated in the future after they have atoned for their crimes.",42,1
"Civil damages are based on the amount of harm suffered. The argument that they are too heavy is probably an argument confused with criminal penalties.　It is natural that the criminal penalty may be light, but the civil damages can be huge. The trial is another matter.　If you accidentally break something and it costs 100 million yen, you will be charged 100 million yen. For this reason, insurance would normally be purchased for about 100 million yen.",4,1
"More than 20 years ago now, when I was 19 years old, I ordered a regular beef bowl at a gyudon restaurant because I had no money and devoured all the red ginger I could find. And I only had more rice. The waitress took pity on me so much that when I came to her, she replaced the box of red ginger with a box of red ginger custard. From the store's point of view, I think he was quite an annoying customer, even though he didn't have any money at the time. I'm grateful to that waitress, even though she was annoying in a way.",35,26
"The calculation of damages in Japan only allows for compensation for actual damages. It is not a system that says, ""Let the offender suffer this much loss. This is in contrast to the U.S., where punitive damages are awarded. By the way, it is good to talk about the rehabilitation and future prospects of children who have committed crimes. That is the purpose of the Juvenile Law. However, that is criminal law. Civil law is not like that. The attitude of civil law is to compensate for the damage caused. If you are so concerned about the rehabilitation and future of the juvenile, I think it would be better if such people donated money to the juvenile's rehabilitation and future. With their support, Sushiro will be compensated and the boy will be saved. If they don't support the boy, then their true intention is somewhere else.",18,1
"The root of the problem of victims' and perpetrators' rights and third-party values regarding criminal acts is the perversion of the concept of ""guilt. The human defensive instinct is to modify memories, forget, or shift responsibility to a convenient interpretation in order to protect one's own psyche. Atonement for a crime, completing a prison sentence, and so on, are all reasons that humans have formed in order to maintain society, and ""guilt"" will never disappear no matter what we do. Nowadays, we often turn our eyes away from the ""fact"" that what happened cannot be pretended to have never happened, and it is necessary to consider crime, punishment, and rights separately before finding a compromise between them. In reality, law is not justice, so it is impossible to protect all people, and order is there to protect the majority. It is necessary to make judgments based on facts, not on the victim, not on the perpetrator, but on order that does not lean too much on sentiments and sympathies. Order, which we are usually unaware of, is also a mechanism that benefits the majority.",1,1
"There are people who say that even if they set a higher amount, the other party would not be able to pay it, or that this is the amount even though the stock price has plummeted, but I think this is just the amount that Sushiro can prove the actual damages. I don't think it's a good idea to file a lawsuit based on how much the other party can pay, and if you look at the TEPCO shareholder class action lawsuit, there are plenty of lawsuits where the amount of money is unaffordable. Sushiro's profits were already down before this incident, so there is no way to prove that sales have dropped. I understand what you are saying about foreign countries, but this is Japan, and I think it is important for Sushiro to fight for what they think is a reasonable amount.",1,1
"In this case, the other party is also a publicly traded company, and it is true that the stock price fell, even if only temporarily, to the detriment of its shareholders. The perpetrator claims that the decline in sales is due in part to issues with competitors, but this is beside the point. If the store side sued in the U.S. for similar acts, the amount of compensation would be more than 1 billion yen, and since this is a country of court cases, unlike Japan, the full amount claimed will be determined as compensation unless there is something more. If you can pay the amount of compensation, there is no problem, but even if you can pay 1 billion yen, it will be difficult to procure the original funds. As shown in the case study, the amount of compensation of 67 million yen is at most 1/10~3/10 of what it would be in a Japanese court. If the company wins the case, it will not have to pay any court costs, but it will be a kind of ""raising an issue.",1,1
"Society may need to help rehabilitate the minor, but only after he has atoned for his crime first. The final amount of compensation will be decided in court, but it is not a high amount to claim as a victim. Considering the damage done to the industry as a whole, it should be much higher.",4,1
"Under the current legal system, it would be useless to raise any amount. After all, since it is treated as a civil matter, seizure is also impossible if the assets are less than the compensation. In this sense, life insurance is invincible. Also, by concealing assets, it is theoretically possible to escape foreclosure. It may be necessary to make this a criminal rather than a civil matter.",3,1
"In other countries, punitive damages are sometimes added to the compensation, but this is Japan. Even if the amount is 60 million yen, if the perpetrator does not have the ability to pay, there is no hope of recovery even if the claim is high, so I feel the amount itself is meaningless. The tolerant opinion toward the perpetrator is probably based on the feeling of the Showa period, when the Internet was not widely used and there was no such thing as rumors spreading on the Internet that could affect stock prices. I think they are wondering if the crime is so serious that a young boy's thoughtless act is enough to make his life a disaster.",7,2
"The company cannot let the boy go scot-free, including against copycats, so I think they hit the nail on the head when they said that they sought minimum social sanctions. Each individual is free to express his or her own opinion on the matter, but what is clear is that there was no reprehensible defect on the part of the company, and the fact that the boy dared to commit an act that did not need to be committed, regardless of the motive, is a fact of decision-making on his part. The judiciary will solemnly rule in accordance with social ethical norms by weighing the interests of both sides based on objective facts.",2,5
"I think it's a good article, 67 million is clearly still a kind amount compared to the damages. This time, though, Sushiro is suing on behalf of Sushiro because Sushiro was the victim. This incident affected the entire conveyor-belt sushi industry. Other chains and restaurants also lost some customers because of this. If all the damages were added up, the amount of money would not be enough. Also, Kazushige Nagashima's suggestion that he should be rehabilitated by making him work at Sushiro, well, let's say you hired him as a part-time worker, and even if you estimate his hourly wage at 1100 yen, that is 2.2 to 2.3 million yen per year, for 67 million yen, would he be prepared to work for about 30 years, where salary = repayment? That's what I'm talking about.",29,3
"A reasonable amount of compensation should be allowed as punishment for the crime. This is where moral hazard comes from. All that remains is for the company to decide whether or not Sushiro should exercise its right to claim. Even if 67 million yen is approved as compensation, it only means that they have the right to make them pay 67 million yen, but it does not mean that they absolutely have to pay it. It is also true that there are those who need to be made properly aware that the real world is not a playground.",2,1
"I have no intention of defending the boy, but the repetition of bait advertisements should be punished with the same passion as blaming the boy. The damage to the customers who were lured by the decoys may be a few hundred yen, but if there are tens of thousands of customers, the damage is in the tens of millions of yen. Leverage is fair for both positive and negative leverage. Recently, I think there are more and more people who take the positive leverage, but don't care about the negative leverage.",2,1
"I think it would be a good idea to increase the number of fines by double digits, considering what will happen in the future, as it will serve as an example to the youngsters and students. The most important thing to do is to make sure that the companies, shareholders, customers, suppliers, contractors, fishermen's cooperatives, net suppliers, and importing countries are all affected, so it's appropriate to demand fines not only from Sushiro but also from the companies involved in the production and sales of the fish.",3,1
"There's no doubt that the boy is bad, but since the problem was originally in the revolving sushi system, I think the restaurant can be held responsible for the cost of the measures used to fill the hole. There is no doubt that the image of the restaurant has been tarnished, but Sushiro had a lot going on before that, and with the impact of Corona, it's hard to say how much of an impact it had on their business performance.",5,29
"The Japanese people love compassion, don't they? They expect a humanistic theater of ""What is going to happen to the boy's future? I think that is the decisive difference from overseas. Everyone has commented on this, but I think it is a mild amount compared to compensation overseas. Japan is a country ruled by law, so it is natural to follow the verdict decided by the court. It may be a big deal, but I think you should think about why you should pay compensation rather than thinking about appealing and lowering the amount of compensation.",8,3
"In a just society, even if a person is a minor, if he or she admits guilt and there is clear evidence, he or she should be held accountable. However, the prosecution, which takes a harsh attitude toward the sentence, and the defense, which wants to lighten the penalty as much as possible, are in conflict, leaving the decision to the trial court. If you want to beat the bad guys easily, all you have to do is shout ""death penalty! In some aspects, the word ""defense"" is substituted for thinking about what else could have been noticed in the surroundings or what preventative measures could have been taken.",1,6
"I will not defend the perpetrator, but it is possible that the restaurant was not a safe place to eat, as it was a risk that could have been anticipated, and it may have been built with many blind spots, which may have attracted a clientele that did not seem well-behaved. Sushiro, too, may differ depending on the time of year and the store, but I used to enjoy eating at Sushiro because it was open and had good visibility, and I could feel the energy of the people working in the restaurant. On the other hand, it was difficult to keep an eye on the children who were misbehaving so that they would not bother other customers seated behind them. Recently, the privacy of customers may have improved, but this has also created many blind spots, and the increasingly automated, self-service atmosphere is likely to increase the number of misbehaving customers. I would like to see a solution to this problem not only through punishment but also through ingenuity, such as customer management using facial recognition and behavior analysis systems in combination with automation.",1,12
"I think it would be a good idea to have a class action lawsuit by a delegation or something to seek compensation, even if it is a small amount for each individual employee or part-timer who is given extra work but not reflected in his/her salary. It would be possible to visualize how many people are being inconvenienced by this kind of action, rather than just the abstract subject of a company.",3,1
"Indeed, I have been resisting eating out lately. I have even decided to take out conveyor-belt sushi. Even though the restaurant industry is capable of hygiene control, the image of the restaurant industry is terrible if the annoying video that spread on SNS is broadcast in the mass media again every day. It is inevitable that the perpetrator will be charged a hefty amount for damages. That is the reality. The social order seems to have been disrupted recently, but the perpetrators should be made to pay for their crimes.",27,1
"One hundred commandments, one hundred punishments,"" is the only word I can think of to describe the situation! The perpetrators may have intended it as a prank, but high school students should be old enough to understand the difference between what is right and wrong (the law treats 18-year-olds as adults). This action is necessary to deter further copycats.",49,2
"It is reported that the juvenile defendant, who is seeking dismissal of the claim in this trial, is claiming that ""the decrease in sales is due to excessive competition with other restaurants,"" as if the decrease in sales is the result of ""excessive competition with other restaurants. In fact, there is a case of a privately owned restaurant that was forced out of business due to a similar illegal act, and it is only natural that a firm response should be taken.",4,2
"It's been a while since I've read an article that I agree with. When it's a ""boy,"" everything is rehabilitated for the future... but this boy and others who act for their own convenience and cause a lot of trouble to others, tried to take away the future of others. Can people who cannot imagine the future understand the ""future"" given to them by hypocrites? I believe that they will live their lives again putting their immediate interests and self convenience first. People's predispositions are hard to change, and their thinking changes only with dramatic environmental changes. For this boy, I think he needs an environment that atones for his sins, not a future of hypocrisy as the former professional baseball player suggests.",15,2
"As for other crimes, etc., the crime committed is in the past, and the criminal should be rehabilitated for the future! The damage itself is treated too much in the past. The laws of this country. There is a lack of understanding of the weight that victims have to bear. As far as the sushi chain is concerned, the cost spent on countermeasures and the cost that will continue to be incurred in the future. That is why the unit price will go up. It will take time to recover the bad image. The damage to the industry as a whole is also significant. If you do something wrong, your future will be destroyed, your family will be inconvenienced, and people around you will look at you with a white eye. It is necessary to make them understand these fears. Japan does not have a law such as a life sentence for repeat offenders who still do not understand.",27,3
"＞The sanitation problems and harmful rumors caused the restaurant to suffer heavy losses and a temporary decline in customer traffic, and the market value of the company's stock is said to have dropped by approximately 16 billion yen, albeit only temporarily. Regardless of the merits of the ¥67 million, the impact on the industry as a whole and on the restaurant industry as a whole has been tremendous, and in other countries the figure might be one or two orders of magnitude higher. It is important to understand that the purpose of the Japanese civil litigation system is not to punish, but to restore the original state of affairs. I think it is a misguided argument to say that we are defending the perpetrator without understanding this point, and that under the current Japanese system, the natural conclusion is to recover damages to the extent that a reasonable causal relationship is recognized for the purpose of restoring the original state of the case.",1,2
"Sushiro's bill this time will certainly be low. However, in light of the ""private"" crimes that have been committed, it will probably be reduced considerably. Due to vulgar media reports and the development of social networking sites, vicious acts are being committed not only against the juvenile but also against his family and school, mainly on the Internet. In light of the current situation where secondary damage is being inflicted even on students attending the same school, it must be said that under the current system, ""private punishment"" is being carried out. I still think it is time to consider some countermeasures. First, I would like to see the school prosecute the person who called the school about this case for ""obstruction of business"". I guess that's a start. Too many people do not know that when an incident occurs, the police have the ""right to investigate,"" and that if a ""private individual"" conducts the investigation, it is a ""private offense,"" and that private punishment, is forbidden.",4,2
"I wonder how few people think about what it would be like to be in that position these days? I guess many people say they feel sorry for themselves even though the beast is out to their houses and their lives are in danger. If the same thing were to happen right in front of me, and my life were in danger, or the company I work for were to lose business because of a prank, others would say it's because I feel sorry for them, but I don't think I could say that if it were me, but if laws were made quickly and the law was enforced, I think this kind of thing would decrease. I think Sushiro did a good thing. Someone has to scold the child.",3,2
"On a personal note, after the series of incidents against the Kaiten Sushi restaurant, I can no longer go to the restaurant. Even when I pass by the restaurant, I have come to the conclusion that I should not go there. I think there may be others like me. I appreciate the firm action taken to prevent this kind of behavior from happening again in the future. I would like to try the conveyor belt sushi restaurant again.",10,1
"This kind of conflict of opinion occurs when the gap between the lack of awareness of the person who caused the incident and the magnitude of the social impact that followed is too great. The person who caused the incident may have been just trying to show off in a mischievous manner, but it spread and had a tremendous impact on the stock price and business of Sushiro, the largest conveyor-belt sushi restaurant in Japan. More specifically, sushi is a category of Japanese food culture. The video has become a catalyst for the destruction of not only Sushiro, but also the very foundation of Japan's food culture, which is built on the principle of sexuality. This has led to a split between the opinion that there is no need to go to such lengths for a mere prank, and the opinion that this level of compensation is rather low considering the social impact. Which is right, the future of the family, including the boy who caused the prank, or the preservation of social order to prevent such criminal behavior from spreading? We have no choice but to accept the guilt, even though we would not have thought that it would have driven us to this point.",3,1
"This is the result of the management company's crisis management capabilities and its failure to incur the necessary costs due to management's reliance on the good nature of its customers. Therefore, although the perpetrator is primarily to blame, the inadequacies and responsibility of the management should also be pursued (at least at the shareholders' meeting). Taking all of this into consideration, it is difficult to determine whether this claim for compensation is appropriate. While I understand the sentiment, it is not appropriate for even the responsibility of the crisis management department to be shifted to the boy's side. Some people emphasize that the stock price fell, but I think that investors disliked the company's inability to predict risk as a company, and it is hard to believe that the perpetrator's actions were the entire cause of the decline.",3,1
"Personally, I agree with the arguments in this article, but on the other hand, I think it would be good to have arguments on the side of the sued. What made me feel uncomfortable was the case of a disabled person causing a commotion in Atami a while ago. I read several articles, and while there were many opinions in the comments section criticizing the disabled side, which I thought was just an attempt to inflame the flames, the articles were all like ""the disabled have a valid point"" as if they were trying to make a point, which made me feel uncomfortable. I suppose it is difficult to criticize the handicapped side as an official comment, but I would like to see the handicapped side make its point in a fair and unbiased manner.",1,1
"It is a meaningless argument to say that the order of magnitude is different from other countries. It is on the same level as saying that Japan has the death penalty but other countries have life sentences. 67 million yen is cheap, but for the boy's family, it is a lot of money and will pay for the rest of their lives. There is no point in charging the full amount of the true loss to those who cannot pay. Perhaps they will settle at a lower level? (The settlement amount will never be made public.) The important thing is that the high damage claims and (in some cases) criminal prosecution will serve as a reasonable deterrent.",3,1
"I have no desire to defend the boy. It was just that the timing was not right. The company was losing credibility by holding fake events and events that were easily misunderstood. Then the price increase was added to the mix, and the number of customers began to wane, and finally the unsolicited video was the final straw. I would like to see the world line of how much the negative impact would have been.",2,13
"67 million yen is so little. How hard did those in the food and beverage industry have to work because of the Corona disaster? Considering how many people and how much damage was caused by that one video, it should be more. Digital tattoos are often a problem, but in this case, I'm glad they were there to make them pay for their sins with a lifetime of regret. No matter how much he regrets it, that video will reappear every time there is a similar incident. I wonder if the defenders have no imagination to imagine if they or their relatives were the victims. The victims have lives and families to protect.",5,2
"I don't know if 100% responsibility for the decline in stock prices is appropriate, but there is no doubt that the company, shareholders, users, and others have suffered tremendous damage, mainly economic, as a result of this inappropriate behavior. The 67 million yen seems like a modest claim.",5,1
The most important thing to do is to make sure that you have the right information and the right people to know what you are doing.  The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your product is to make sure that it is not a product that is going to be used for other purposes.,55,4
"As I have written in other articles, considering the total amount of damage and inconvenience to Sushiro as well as the damage to the image of the entire restaurant industry, it is clear that the 67 million yen compensation amount is reasonable. However, if they are so dissatisfied, they should be compensated for all the damages that are currently available, even if they are in the hundreds of millions of dollars. If you are so dissatisfied, you should make him pay for all the damages, even if they are in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Even if it is not possible to achieve 100%, I believe that even one case will deter the juvenile in the future. I think this comment is exactly right, and we need to be aware that we cannot hide things only in Japan through social networking sites.",4,1
"Regardless of what the rest of the country is doing, I think the uproar has reduced the number of people coming in. I think many people had their shifts cut because of it. Considering the number of stores, the number of employees, the shifts they lost, the salary they should have earned but lost, and the loss to Sushiro, I think it must have been very cheap. There should have been no reason for them to be disadvantaged.",2,1
"In Japan, under the Juvenile Law, juvenile offenders are punished on the basis of the principle of ""good character"" that juveniles can be rehabilitated. It seems that the majority of the media coverage of this case is based on the argument that the juvenile offender's human rights or rehabilitation is an obstacle to rehabilitation. However, when we look at past juvenile crimes, many of them are repeat offenders, are they not? Moreover, there are those who consider the lenient punishment for juvenile crimes to be a backward step, as in the case of the robber who was sent to the family court and did not get a criminal record. There are some reports that the boy in this case is reflecting on his crime and that his mother is exhausted, but it is not surprising, and I am not sure if he really wants to be rehabilitated. If he really wants to be rehabilitated, I think he and his family should spend the rest of their lives making amends.",3,1
"One of the reform initiatives of Elon Musk, who acquired Twitter, is to reduce advertising revenue to 50% or less. If this is to be done as a consistent regulation of highly criminal posts, as in this case seen on Twitter and YouTube, I have to say that it is very prescient. The more we rely on ad revenue, the less easy it will be to stop posts with high PV, and the more discovery will be made for advertisers.",1,1
"Most people who are called ""liberals"" are basically smart. However, perhaps because they are so smart, they lack experience of hardships in the real world, and their ideas, words, and actions often seem to be empty theories based on theories or dreams that do not fit the reality. This tendency seems to be particularly severe when it comes to discussions of politics, economics, and other issues that are far removed from the topics around them.",1,1
"The biggest mistake of the media is reporting the claim for compensation as a punishment against the perpetrator. A claim for compensation is the right of the victim, and the perpetrator has the obligation to compensate the victim for his/her losses. Therefore, no one has the right to criticize a just compensation amount. You can say that it is excessive to claim for the collapse of the stock price, but it is a legitimate claim for the cost of taking measures that were not necessary before because of the perpetrator's actions.",4,3
"Well, both are good arguments, but in the U.S., I think it is often the case that ""you don't file a lawsuit against someone you can't get an amount you can't get"". Even if the damage is the same, the amount of the lawsuit depends on ""the amount of money you are likely to get from the other party. Even in the case of automobile accidents, there are arguments from the very beginning, such as, ""How much is your insurance worth? It is rather like the way settlement amounts are set in Japan. (Incidentally, in the U.S. there is no such thing as unlimited indemnity insurance.) Surprising compensation may be offered in punitive lawsuits, but only if the other party is a company that has continued to engage in serious misconduct or if it can be covered by insurance. If the amount is calculated on a ""damage basis"" and cannot be recovered, all that is spent on litigation and attorney's fees is simply taken out of your pocket. The real focus of this lawsuit is not ""how much did you demand in the lawsuit"" but ""how much will you settle for?"" This will be kept private, so the situation will end up being unclear.",1,1
"Although it is a low amount in terms of the original damages, it is an amount that can be paid and realized as a judgment. Considering the cost of claiming damages, I think it is a reasonable amount in terms of effectiveness in deterring copycat crimes, etc.",2,2
"Recently, with the loss of the Corona restrictions, convenience store bento boxes have become more expensive, and I've been eating out a lot more. I'm not defending the boy, but I've come to think that those who were disappointed with Sushiro because of this incident were probably expecting too much from the restaurant.",1,4
"I am not defending the victim. I am saying that the sanctions are too great for an act of youthful indiscretion. When you say that other countries would have different orders of magnitude, which countries are you referring to? If it were Myanmar or Cambodia, I'm sure it would end up being some other story that wouldn't even be talked about. Even in developed countries, I think it's less hysterical to be this hysterical against children. It is good that many people agree with this article because everyone has a different way of thinking, but I think this article is very biased.",6,32
"The privacy and future of the juvenile should be protected to the maximum extent possible. However, that has nothing to do with the damage done to the victim. If the juvenile is not responsible, it is natural that the parents would be. As for the position of those who want to follow up on the situation, they may be worried that their own children may become like this, or they may feel that they cannot exclude the boy from society because he will also be a member of society in the future. I think it is no wonder that the TV personality is saying incoherent things because his comments come from these feelings. I assume that this is because washing dishes is often mentioned as a punishment, but we need to be very aware that there is no such thing as a noble or lowly position in someone's profession. I also think that the severe bashing of juveniles by third parties and exposure like private punishment should be stopped, but I think that it is necessary to properly recognize the crime and punishment in a judicial forum.",1,1
"It seems that the perpetrator's lawyer said, ""He is also remorseful,"" but even if he is remorseful, the damage to the restaurant will not decrease. Whether or not he is sorry is a matter for him and his family to decide, so why not ask others to agree? Until now, underage offenses have been kept to a minimum because of the future, but if they can cause such a big incident, I wonder if we have to rethink this.",17,1
"Such lawsuits will vary from country to country. In the U.S., huge compensation claims are made, but expensive lawsuits are rare in Europe and other countries. Yes, the loss to a company may be significant, but the ability to pay is fundamentally different from that of an individual. If the compensation cost is in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, it is likely to involve not only the individual but also his/her family members, making them jointly and severally liable. While these articles will fuel the calls for compensation, I don't think this will make the world a better place.",4,26
"The claim is not a punishment for the perpetrator boy, but rather a compensation for the damage he has suffered due to his actions, so it is only natural that he should be charged. The actual amount of damages suffered would not be this small, although it would depend on how you estimate the amount. Considering that, I think the amount of the claim is quite warm.",4,1
"To begin with, conveyor-belt sushi is a model in which the goodwill of customers is converted to cost reduction and selling prices are lowered, so I don't think it is fair to unilaterally say that the restaurant side is 100% good. I am sure it will become clear in a civil trial, but I think it was necessary for the restaurant to take measures based on the customers' bad intentions, such as plates, soy sauce, tea, and gari (pickled ginger).",3,9
"I think there are several factors that contribute to the spread of this kind of annoying behavior: the spread of social networking sites is one, but I think the biggest factor is that adults have stopped being able to scold minors, or have made it impossible to scold them. Scolding is also very important for the education and discipline of minors. The main source of the mistake is that the media used social opinions and trends to prevent people from doing that at home and school.",3,1
"If a person is found doing sushipero and is offended, a stern warning on the spot may be acceptable, but when the video is posted on the Internet, even in private, it becomes a serious crime. Those who are defending the incident because it was a child's mischief are, in my opinion, irresponsible people with little imagination who do not understand the implications of uploading such images on the Internet. If the perpetrator is a minor, the parents must take responsibility. And the media definitely played a role in spreading the damage.",18,1
"The scope of damages to be compensated for by Japanese civil courts is extremely narrow. In other words, the market price of compensation is very low. In terms of the price to value ratio, it is probably the lowest in the world. In addition, there is no punitive damages. The story goes that the soy sauce jugs in the seating area are inherently unsanitary, a fact that was brought to everyone's attention by this video, and that's why customers stopped coming to the restaurant in the first place. It does not mean that the boy who committed the crime made other restaurants' soy sauce jugs unsanitary. If this is the case, it is difficult to say whether the decrease in sales of other restaurants and other companies in the industry is related to the incident.",3,4
"I think it would be better to make these people do community service instead of washing dishes in stores or cleaning kitchens. For example, if it is the coming season, they should be made to weed for several hours under the blazing sun, or they should be made to pick up trash in the city for a day and not be allowed to leave until they have collected 100 bags of trash per person. Of course, we would also have to consider the punishment for escaping.",1,1
"It is the judiciary that judges. We are paying attention to how the judiciary will judge. If the court ruling (amount of compensation) is too far away from the feelings of the victims, there will be more copycats and more companies will suffer damage. It is a fact that the safety of the restaurant industry has been threatened by their games. Considering the seriousness of the situation, I do not think the amount of money being sued is too much.",1,1
"It's that former professional baseball player's expression of dishwashing. Surely you can't blame him for looking down on dishwashing and cleaning. I am a dishwasher and cleaner myself, and let me tell you, it is not an easy job. And washing dishes is not the only job. Of course, it is necessary to clean and sterilize dishes. After that, there is the storage and rearrangement of washed dishes, so it is not something that can be done casually.",4,1
"I can't fully support this company because of their incomprehensible sale posters and early stock-outs of special menu items, but I do support them on this matter. I think there are few lives lost from unknowingly using Pero Pero, but I have become distrustful of the ever-present condiments in restaurants. I would like to see stores and public facilities improve so that security cameras are permanently installed and obviously malicious videos can be arrested, prosecuted, and claimed for damages for it.",2,1
"As part of Internet literacy, it is important to remember that the Internet makes no distinction between adults and children. If the clerk had caught the child in the act of ""peropero"" in the act and given him a stern warning, there would have been no need for a trial. However, this child had taken a picture of her own criminal act and uploaded it to a social networking site. At that moment, the impact of this act became ""it doesn't matter if the culprit is a child or an adult. I believe that schools are already educating children that it is dangerous to expose their private life on social networking services, but at the same time, parents should also educate their children that it is dangerous to hand over their smartphones to their children.",2,1
"I am sure there are many people who have been inconvenienced in addition to those directly affected. When I was working in a restaurant, I used to think that just because there was news about food falsification or food safety, this was not falsification either. Don't make me eat strange food. Some customers would joke with me, ""Don't make me eat strange food. Not only is it not funny, but it makes the customers who hear it uneasy, and from the employee's point of view, this is the fifth person to make that joke today. The reality is that it cannot be a problem in one place.",1,1
"There is no point in demanding an absurd amount of compensation from someone who has no ability to pay. Even if Sushiro receives 67 million yen, they will not be able to make up the difference at all. It is more important to show the world the reality that the minor himself will be imprisoned for two years or more without probation and his salary except for the minimum living expenses will be seized to repay the debt for about 10 years as an example to prevent recidivism. The perpetrator will earn and desperately pay his debts in order to be free quickly in that situation. By the time they finish paying the debt, they will understand the cost and will learn the importance of skills and money and earn more money because they had to work harder than others and will never lose their life. If the parents pay the compensation on their shoulders, no matter how large the sum, the person will live a normal life and forget that it is in the past. Even if the person is unhappy with his/her relatives, it is not as much of a lesson to these types of people as other people think. Shut up, I'm going to live on my own! And that's the end of it. The usual pattern is that the person does not pay back much of the money he or she has spent.",2,1
"I think the perpetrator needs some protection, but isn't it the victim who needs more protection? In the case of Sushiro, it's a large chain store, so you think they can get away with it. But what about the full time and part time employees who work there, and the vendors who unload goods to Sushiro? The day after this came out, the stock price plummeted and the number of customers dropped, and even if they adjusted the hours of the staff, they couldn't make up for it. Yet, the amount of this bill is also a warm-up for Sushiro. If it were overseas, they would be charged the full amount of the loss. Please think about that before you speak out.",2,1
"It is not a question of whether or not the company can actually recover the money, but rather, it is important to make society aware of the amount of damage that can be caused by the nuisance, so there is no need to take into account any kind of trickery in the amount of the claim. It is the judge's job to take into account the amount of the damage, and the company must present the actual amount of the damage accurately.",1,1
"They should seek compensation for damages that are not even worth mentioning. As with the recent public uproar over incomprehensible things like the former politicians of the Restoration Association, these people should be thoroughly sanctioned. There are people who try to earn income easily through YouTube, etc., but I hope that tax investigations of such people will be thoroughly investigated. No matter how much we talk about freedom and diversity, it is only under the law, and we should be aware of that.",2,1
"I am often surprised when I see judgments in the U.S. that award damages that are off the charts, but they include punishment, don't they? I heard that the Japanese judicial system does not include punishment, so it is not likely that only this case will be sentenced with the amount including punishment. If the amount is based on actual damages and physical and mental fatigue, it is not likely to be a significant amount. The stock price is not a case of actual manipulation of the stock price. I wonder if that will be accepted.",4,2
"Frankly, if it's a convinced and malicious act, I think we should hunt it down thoroughly. Why the victim's side needs to make concessions with warmth is completely incomprehensible. A sincere apology from the offender and compensation for the actual damage are the minimum, and only in areas beyond that can the perspective of ""since he is a minor"" and ""future rehabilitation"" be added to the discussion.",10,1
"Not only in this case, but in the media reports, the perpetrators are often defended. I think it would be good to hear viewers' opinions on-time, since some TV programs nowadays allow viewers to participate and take surveys. In most cases, there is a divergence of opinion between commentators and the general public. I think it would be a win-win situation for the TV stations to fire commentators whose opinions diverge too much, so that they can get more viewer ratings....",2,2
"I think conveyor-belt sushi is an industry built on high morals and peace in Japan. I think this is one of the advantages of Japan compared to other countries. I think it is natural for Sushiro to take a firm stance that it will not tolerate any actions that seriously damage the company's profits and trust in the restaurant industry. There is no doubt that the judiciary will decide whether the amount of compensation is high or low. If the juvenile wants to serve the law, he should do so, and those who want to support his attitude toward rehabilitation should do so as well. Neither asking Sushiro, who has suffered a great deal, to reduce his sentence, nor violating the privacy of the perpetrator or the human rights of his family, is something that should not be done. In this case, the act of disregard for the social order must not be tolerated, but I feel that those who criticize must not overstep the bounds of law and morals either.",4,1
"Along with the convenience of the ease with which individuals can transmit information on social networking sites in this day and age, there is also a sense of fear and weight, and I think we need to understand this. If you do not understand this, it is safer not to use smartphones or the Internet. It is different from 30 years ago, when there was no Internet, because the damage and impact on others is enormous, even if it is done lightly.",1,1
"Realistically speaking, the Gifu Masaki store is the only store that was directly affected by the boy, so can the boy alone be held responsible for the costs and damages incurred by all the Sushiro stores? I'm sure this will be a point of contention at the trial as well, and the defense will naturally argue that it's ridiculous to charge him for expenses incurred at other unrelated stores as well.",1,8
"If a lawsuit is filed, the perpetrator must atone for the crime he or she committed... With this as the basic principle, the rest is left to the judicial decision. The perpetrator's lawyer will do everything possible to reduce the sentence or the amount of compensation, which is the lawyer's job. I think that the media and the Yahoo! commenters here are getting too involved and making a big fuss about it, which is a complete turnaround. If you want to think about rehabilitation, after the sentence (compensation) is decided, people who feel sorry for him should collect donations, or the perpetrator himself should write a letter of remorse or a pledge and raise part of the compensation through crowdfunding or other means. I think the first step is for the perpetrator to admit the crime he committed, realize the gravity of the situation, and start thinking about rehabilitation from that point on...",1,1
"Protecting a juvenile is not the same thing as giving him a lighter or more lenient sentence for his crime. Think about what will happen if we reduce sentences or overly protect juveniles just because they are juveniles. The crime committed will not be questioned, the victims will cry themselves to sleep, similar acts will be perpetrated in many places, and the social order will collapse. It's a world where the ""doer"" wins. That is not juvenile protection. The principle of juvenile protection is that the crime committed and the punishment received should be equal.",1,2
"The Japanese judiciary is very warm-hearted. If it's true, I think the order of magnitude is different from what this guy is saying. But this is Japan, there is no way the perpetrators can pay the billions of dollars, and if they abuse the victim any more, the perpetrators will not be able to make a living, and the whole family will be killed. At least it has served as a deterrent to crime, right?",2,1
"Rehabilitating juveniles, that's certainly important. This rehabilitation means teaching them that they are responsible for their actions and that they must be punished and held accountable for their wrongdoings. In other words, the first step to rehabilitation is to make sure that the boy is fit into a proper mold.",1,1
"I think we should be more strict with them because they are minors.　How much trouble did you cause your parents and the high school you attended by doing something just for fun? If the friend who was taking pictures is not to blame, he or she should receive some kind of legal punishment.　If the friend who was taking pictures is not blamed, then the friend should also receive some kind of legal punishment. In that sense, I think it is unfair. I think it is unfair in that sense.",2,1
"Families, education, and rehabilitation facilities cannot afford it. It takes time and effort to seriously confront and rehabilitate people. Even so, they are often betrayed. We have to give up on rehabilitation. Is there no other way but to punish them severely? We are living in an age where people are not valued. This also creates a vicious cycle.",3,1
"Since this incident was first reported, I have been saying that it is not ""perpetrator vs. company"" but ""perpetrator vs. workers who are in a weak position"" as in the content of this article. Apparently, only those who easily talk about ""minors"" and ""rehabilitation"" are willing to say something misguided like ""It's a major company, so they should be more magnanimous..."". Have you ever thought about those who lost their jobs or lost their income indirectly, even though they were not at fault in this case? And. People who easily forgive other people's crimes without any qualifications, only think about the victims' damage. If you think about it... if the reputational damage causes actual losses, full-time employees may only have to take a bonus cut, but for other workers, there may be part-timers and part-timers who had to reduce their work hours to adjust, or who were fired in the first place... Don't you have the imagination to think about that? I wonder if they have the imagination to think about it. Rehabilitation is a matter for the perpetrator's family and the school board, not for the victim company.",2,1
"Decent articles are rare. The Internet is a place where only good arguments for what is right are acceptable, but on TV, no one listens to what is obvious. Therefore, in order to earn viewer ratings, it is easy for people to appear who go crazy with a sense of contrarian righteousness against a sound argument. That TV craziness was often left unchecked in the past, but now it is used by netizens for self-assurance by slamming such TV programs and newspapers. As a result, the Internet becomes more and more rampant with righteous opinions, while TV and newspapers become more and more evil and only a few heretical opinions have a presence.",1,2
"I think the compensation claim is cheap and the hypocritical defense of the unrelated media is laughable. The criminal activity is so vicious that in the past there have been cases of bankruptcy in stores on an individual level. The reality is that they will probably settle for a low amount that is far from what they claim. The victim has the right to claim, so a harsh sentence is fine, and if the payment is too severe, the victim can make a concession to reduce the amount of compensation at their own discretion. I don't think it's right for people who have no direct interest in the damage caused to decide the amount of compensation.",2,3
"Sushiro does not ""punish"", it is the judiciary that decides, not Sushiro. ＞＞First of all, the 67 million yen is not a ""punishment"" but a compensation for the damages suffered by the victim, and this amount of compensation will not hinder the rehabilitation of this boy. I think they should be punished severely.",1,2
"Well, I guess the fact that such a large number of people exist is a reality that is hard to move. They are susceptible to easy-to-understand stories of sob stories and rehabilitation of bad people, or they are easily swept away. Some people take advantage of such sentiments, and they believe that notoriety is better than obscurity. In fact, when I see that articles by former YouTubers still attract comments, I wonder what is going on. Of course, there is the aspect that it is because the media writes about them. I think that is part of the nature of human beings. We process information unconsciously, with various biases and influenced by our emotions.",1,1
"In other countries, the bill would definitely be in the billions at least. The actual judgment (verdict) is another matter. According to what I hear, Sushiro is considering adding to the claim, but I guess that's just an emotional argument. The perpetrator filed a lawsuit seeking dismissal of the claim for damages, so I guess they were like, ""What a bastard.... It's true that they tried to make a profit from the video, so it's wise to apologize and work toward a settlement. Sushiro's side will not agree to it, though.",1,2
"The article itself is quite honest. If even the slightest prank can cause a great deal of damage, it is not acceptable to say that the person did not know about it or that it was done inadvertently. To put it in an extreme way, think about what would happen if you placed a stone on the track as a prank and caused a derailment accident as a result.",1,1
"Well, it is true that the amount of compensation is lower than in other countries, but by that theory, the fine for Sushiro's decoy advertisement (in reality, there is no fine, only an action order from the Consumer Affairs Agency) would also be a big problem, so I think both sides are being helped.",4,12
"The public should be there for the victims first and foremost, right? It is the victim first and foremost who should be sympathetic, not the perpetrator! If we have time to defend them, isn't it time to correct the mistakes of ""people who don't know better"" like these perpetrators? Dragging down decent people and businesses is not only wasting their efforts and dedication. Isn't it also the responsibility of the media to teach people that such actions trample on the conscience and trust of those living in society? If we don't report from that perspective, the media has no reason to exist. It may be gone already.",3,1
"The topic of rights and obligations is far removed from this topic, but the neighbors in the apartment complex are super smokers, and they suffer from poisonous smoke pollution from the balcony, exhaust vents, and ventilation fans day and night, day after day. Even in the face of the damage and the human rights issue of not being able to open the windows even in mid-summer, the landlord, UR, defends the rights of the smokers as the aggressors (freedom of smoking) and, conversely, forces the victims to move out. Furthermore, even the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which is supposed to protect the victims of unreasonable passive smoking, the local health department, and the police department, which have jurisdiction over the revised Passive Smoking Prevention Law, and even the judge at the trial, who could not bear the damage and filed a lawsuit, supported the view that passive smoking victims in apartment buildings are not protected by the law and that the landlord, UR, has abandoned its responsibility to provide a good living environment for its tenants, I despair of the collapse of ethics in this country.",2,1
"Some people incorrectly interpret that because they are minors, they will not be caught. However, what about acting for fun and not thinking of the trouble people are going through? You may agree or disagree with this article, but the fact is that there are many incidents that cannot be justified because they are children. Where is the standard for where to go from here to where it is good or bad? It just doesn't change the crime.",2,2
"As a nation under the rule of law, it is only natural that they should be judged by the judiciary, even if they are minors. The fact that there have been so many imitations of YouTubers, even though they may be imitations of annoying YouTubers, should be judged carefully. However, I think that exposing the identity and personal information of the perpetrators on social networking sites is a misunderstanding of justice. If we are talking about the human rights of the perpetrators, those who expose the personal information of the perpetrators should also be judged. I think this is also a matter of course.",4,2
"It is estimated to have fallen by approximately 16 billion yen. →The simple calculation of 16.8 billion yen as the difference between the closing price on the first day, 145 yen x the number of shares, is within the range of F&LC's usual price fluctuation. And the stock price continued to rise from the next day until mid-April. Where is the loss in this? And if you call it a loss, even if it is only for one moment in time, the loss is to shareholders. The story is a mess. But in another country, the figure might be one or two orders of magnitude higher. →I would like to see a precedent, not just ""maybe.",2,1
"Rehabilitation may be important to keep them from reoffending. But only after all have received the punishment equivalent to the crime. After you have atoned for all the crimes you committed, right? First of all, it's punishment, reparation for the crime. That's why you have a punishment called the death penalty. If you commit a crime that cannot be atoned for even if it takes a lifetime to atone for it, unfortunately, it is a problem before rehabilitation.",2,3
"In Japan, it is often the case that the perpetrators claim the rights of the perpetrators and disparage the victims, so I agree with giving the absolute advantage to the victims. who uploaded the video onto the Internet, or who reproduced it in a funny way, are victims. In other words, he is both the perpetrator and the victim, so it is right to compensate Sushiro in good faith. At the same time, I think it would be better to disclose information to those who committed such acts on the Internet, find out their whereabouts, and compensate them for damages.",2,1
"It is true that the anchor said that they would rather hire someone to wash dishes and clean up to improve their image, but washing dishes and cleaning up also requires professionalism. If that is the case, why not have them work as program ADs at the show's knee? In the caster's way of speaking, it might improve the media's image, although being an AD is hard work too.",68,6
"The problem for the perpetrator is that 'they won't let me rehabilitate myself. They can't work to pay for their damages, but they are not allowed to work. Even if they worship their parents and siblings and prepare reparations, the stigma caused by the Internet will not disappear. In the end, they start thinking if there is any way to earn money by causing trouble like Hezuma. If it's true, they need to start over and return to society once they've been punished and compensated for their sins, but I think that's why they're so defensive because they won't let that happen.",1,3
"I think companies have been really bothered by this kind of annoying (?) behavior until now. I think that until now, companies have been really bothered by this kind of annoying (?) behavior. I would like to support ""Sushiro"" who thought that if they don't let those who have licked the adults (the world) have a scary experience, they will not understand and it will not decrease. I would like to ask those who defend the perpetrators, if you want to protect (defend) them so much, are you showing your actions such as paying 67 million for that child (rehabilitation) or asking for donations?",13,1
"Even recently, there have been articles about the culprit being remorseful and the parents being exhausted, but such things are a given. I can only laugh at them, as if they should be made to do the dishes, or if it were not an old-time coming-of-age drama. If it were really in the U.S., they could have demanded 100 times this amount of compensation. You are lucky to have been born in Japan, and you should atone for your sins.",1,1
"This talent is just another person.　Would they be able to remain calm if they were subjected to the desecration of the ground on which they have devoted their lives?　Would you ask him to do the work of a backstage worker whom you had taken care of and respected as a ""substitute"" for punishment?　Even if it is for rehabilitation.　I wish the media would not question every commentator, but use the right person for the right job.",1,1
">This is a large amount in a country where such acts have been dismissed as ""mischief"". Depending on future court cases, damages could be added on top of that. Isn't this also true for ""bullying""? If it becomes commonplace to hold perpetrators accountable for bullying and to seek damages in the hundreds of millions of dollars and to punish them criminally, this will serve as a deterrent, and the number of bullying incidents will probably decrease a little. Also, if the school side were to set penalties for bullying and even heavier penalties for covering it up, the school side would take it more seriously.",1,1
"Well, you should first reduce the amount of payment in court, taking into account extenuating circumstances, etc. Then file a lawsuit against the person who took the video and the person who uploaded it as an accomplice. Then file a lawsuit against the person who filmed and uploaded the video as an accomplice and get some money. Then, you can re-sign the payment terms and conditions. It is not an amount that cannot be paid. The responsibility is heavy.",1,1
"I don't think that everything should be in the U.S., but there was a case in the U.S. where an elderly woman got burned by a McDonald's coffee between her thighs and was awarded 500 million yen or so in compensation. Even though the US is strict about corporate compensation, I thought that was excessive in the Japanese sense. But in this case, the damage to Sushiro (as opposed to McDonald's) is clearly significant. The lawyer for the assailant seems to be saying that the decrease in sales was not because of that, but because they lost out to another vendor. One might certainly view the spinning and no hood as negligence on Sushiro's part. But I think this is significant if you include the damage to similar fast food restaurants. The restaurant trusted its customers in the sense of self-service. It may sound preposterous, but I would be willing to pay 500 million yen for that. The Japanese court system is very precedent-based.",1,4
"We have heard many stories of filthy practices on the kitchen side for a long time, so I think it is in the best interest of the industry to spend money on monitoring and other safety measures, and to pass the savings on to the price. It is impossible to have both cheapness and safety. It is time to change our mindset to get rid of the deflationary spirit.",1,1
"It could even become a political issue. Sushiro, though, is doing what it does with a business license. There is the judgment of the government, and there is also Sushiro's management system. It was the company that gave people smart phones in the first place, and it was also the company that popularized social networking without telling people about the dangers of using it. If Sushiro makes enemies of the public, it will make enemies of the government and the administration. If they take a political risk, they can't afford this kind of loss, and although they don't have a jury, they can fire the Supreme Court justices who make a decision they don't agree with, and since they are making enemies of political parties and others, it will be a troublesome issue. And they are suddenly claiming 67 million yen in damages against a minor.",1,6
"An amount that could be paid back if they worked hard. I don't know if it is a warm-heartedness or an amount of money that Sushiro can prove with certainty that they were actually harmed, but I think it is a small amount of money for the price of causing such a public uproar. Some people may have had their lives changed as a result of this. Just because we are young and lack imagination does not mean that everything is forgiven. There are things in this world that cannot be undone, and what cannot be undone by apology must be atoned for by jail time or money. Or both. In any case, you must clean up your own mess.",4,2
"The American system of punitive damages is intended to hurt large corporations and rich people by increasing the amount of compensation when the perpetrator is a large corporation or rich person, and to serve as a deterrent. It is not a system that increases the amount of compensation when the perpetrator is an ordinary person because the victim is a big company, as in this case.",1,1
"I am not defending the perpetrators, but the companies that are supposedly the victims are also at fault to a great extent. Like continuing to pass around raw sushi without covering it in a place where people are talking loudly (risk of droplet infection). The acrylic plates and other measures had to be done even without this incident, and it is unreasonable to ask the perpetrator to pay for all the costs.",2,5
"This incident is probably a serious matter of interest to many people, namely, the damage to confidence in the environment for safe eating out. I also feel that the former baseball player's comments are the cause of discomfort in that they interpret the operational response of a major restaurant chain in a sporadic drama-like worldview. However, there is one part of the article that concerns me. I feel that too much emphasis is placed on the aspect of preventing the occurrence of similar cases in the future by claiming a large amount of compensation in relation to the concept of compensation filed by the restaurant giants. If this aspect is overemphasized, I am concerned that it may lead to a punitive (general preventive) approach to lawsuits for damages. Of course, it is assumed that the restaurant company in question calculates the amount of damages that can be legally claimed as appropriate when filing a lawsuit. However, if the general preventive effect of compensation is overemphasized in news reports and commentary articles, I am concerned that the defendants in civil lawsuits, which offer fewer judicial guarantees than criminal trials in which court-appointed defense counsel are appointed, will be forced to bear an excessive burden.",2,1
"It doesn't matter if you are a minor or an adult, if you commit a crime, you will be punished. People who talk about washing dishes, don't they know how customers would feel about dishes washed by people who acted insanely? I think that would be a problem for the restaurant. It's not pleasant to see the defense of the perpetrators in this country. Some of them may have hit rock bottom after the stock market plunged, and I'm sure the employees have had to bear a considerable burden. Can't you put the victims first?",4,1
"It's not ""mischief,"" it's obstruction of business; it's not ""bullying,"" it's assault, harassment, defamation, extortion, theft. The ""terminology"" created to keep schools from giving up their self-discretion has been used to trivialize the reality of malfeasance. Licking a soy sauce jug, for example, would be a ""naughty"" thing to do. Charging the actual cost is sufficient. However, if the act is spread on social networking sites for the sake of self-approval, it is an obstruction of business. Since it is obstruction of business, it is only natural to demand compensation for damages. To let this boy off the hook means that the general public and shareholders will shoulder the damage caused by this. Those who think Sushiro is going too far can help the boy with court costs by donating to the cause.",6,1
"If it is because the child is a minor, then the parents should be held responsible, and in fact, I am a parent myself, so if my child causes such a problem, it will come to me. I don't understand the defense of the perpetrator, to say the least. They think that because they have done these things, they will be forgiven anyway, and that if they apologize, they will be able to get away with it. These defenders can only say this because they are not the victims.",1,1
"This amount of money is too low considering the cost of the significant nationwide decline in customers, the unexpected measures to deal with Peropero at all stores nationwide, the system change, the further decline in stock price, and employee training. Although it was a joke, it must have been a malicious act done on purpose. I think the bill should be more than 300 million yen.",1,1
"At least in my own small circle of friends, I've never met anyone who is defensive in this kind of small talk. I think TV commentators are scripted, so I can't really know what they really think.

Talent should experience the work themselves.",1,1
"There is no need to be shy about the amount of compensation. It would be too much to consider the desire to rehabilitate the youth and liability compensation on the same level. Those who want to rehabilitate them should not only have feelings but also actual actions. If they are really thinking about rehabilitation, they should at least do it, at least to part-swap a portion of the compensation.",2,1
"If possible, I would like them to go on TV with their faces and names to apologize, express their determination on how they will live their lives, and compensate for the damage. I would like them to remind the public that the crime of threatening food safety cannot be atoned for by an individual.",2,2
"Moreover, for some reason, there seems to be a law in Japanese courts that the judgment on a claim for compensation is one-tenth of the amount claimed, and some people think that the actual amount claimed may be around 6.7 million yen. Some people can pay that much, and some may even wonder if they can get away with that much. In a society where only the perpetrators are protected, public safety will only worsen.",1,3
"If the compensation for this case is fixed at a few million yen, there will be a lot of copycats who could theoretically make over 10 billion yen by shorting the stock and then buying it back, right? The judicial discounting could destroy the Japanese economy, and it would be such an influential precedent.",1,1
"They say it's cheap, but in reality, I doubt they can pay even 67 million. After all, in Japan, there are many people who overpay even if they are ordered to pay. I think it would be better to make the amount higher to prevent recurrence, but after the judgment is issued, Japan, unlike other countries, is lax on all matters. The higher the amount, the more people give up and lose the will to repay the debt.",2,5
"Japan has long extolled the virtues of tolerance toward perpetrators, calling it ""virtue. However, this is an act that leaves the victim in the lurch, and if taken too far, it can lead to a world in which ""the doer wins. There should be a certain price to be paid for willful malice and stupidity, whether criminal or civil.",6,1
"The perpetrator's conscience will probably be such that he will file for bankruptcy and take the position that he cannot pay, so I think he will settle for 2 or 3 million yen. There is no need to report this, so I think we should report the fact that they will be charged.",2,1
"It is only natural that the affected companies and industries should claim the estimated amount of damages, and leave it to the judiciary to decide whether the amount is reasonable or not. In general, Japan's criminal law is too lenient on young people. Some in the public are naively saying that protecting them encourages their growth, but the opposite is true: it encourages them to grow up.",4,1
"My mother-in-law works as a probation officer and I don't think she has a good job like that. She just has an interview once every few months, and it only lasts about 10 minutes. Then, they fill out the paperwork and that's it. The boy comes to the interview and says, ""I'm working"" or ""I'm studying,"" and he's okay. In reality, there might be a guarantor or something, but even so, it's still not very fair. Interviews are often cancelled. I've been doing this kind of work for 35 years, and now I'm getting a medal of honor. I'm surprised. The way they are doing it now, they can't even provide rehabilitation, and they don't protect the people who are victims. It is a strange country.",2,2
"There is no point in comparing ourselves with other countries. The higher the amount, the more the plaintiff's attorney's fees will rise, and if they cannot recover the money, it will be meaningless. It would be more realistic to sell the house and borrow money from relatives to pay for the damages (and even that is only if you have relatives with assets and financial resources). The reality is that most of the victims of crimes do not receive even a penny in compensation.",3,1
"In addition to this article, I would add that, on the other hand, it would be a good idea to stop making harsh arguments against compensation only when there is a corporate scandal. Of course, corporate responsibility is not light, but it is too unbalanced to be criticized for only taking responsibility seriously and charging too much. I don't think that is healthy.",1,1
I hope that those who were happy to make a fuss together will also be convicted of a crime. It's an incident that has changed the way Japanese food culture and restaurants operate.,4,1
"It might have been a different story if the boy had gotten down on his knees and asked for help and offered to do menial labor for free. It is certainly not right for the victim side to approach the victim to ask for menial labor. When you become a victim and a perpetrator, you have to put someone in between you and the law, so the opportunity for the parties to communicate with each other is drastically reduced. This is the only way to do it if you have a lawyer and a court case in between. The victim's anger is understandable. However, as I watched this exchange with a distant look, I thought that the liability society is a bit harsh on the world because you don't have to negotiate by yourself.",3,2
"The president of Sushiro said on HOLLY ONE that he is a victim in a sense, so I think the company is offering this amount to the public, but he is a minor and has been socially sanctioned enough, and I think the court will settle for a few million in settlement.",1,1
"The share price on the day before the peropero incident = 3015 yen The share price after the peropero incident = 2870 yen The loss of 16 billion yen due to the 145 yen per share drop is well reported so far. But in fact, the current share price is around 3,340 yen, which is about 36 billion yen higher than before the incident. No article, including this one, has gone as far as this. Why? Why is the stock price up? It seems to me that they are intentionally concealing the fact that the boy's crime might be looked down upon if they write that the market value is higher now than it was before the incident. Also, I am sure you are all thinking that although the video revealed the dirty and disturbing behavior, there are probably other similar disturbing behavior that did not make it to the video. Both before and after the video. Sushiro is not unaware of the nuisances before and after the video. Why didn't they tell us? They should have taken countermeasures such as partitioning the space as soon as they became aware of the problem. If it was installed before the video, it was Sushiro's capital investment. If it was installed after the video, the boy should be charged. Something doesn't feel right.",1,1
"The defendant should keep in mind that the 67 million was only compensation for ""Sushiro alone"" and that the restaurant industry itself has been hit harder than that. I wonder if the defendant thinks that 67 million is too much for such a small amount.",1,1
"In fact, it is meaningless to claim an unrecoverable amount if it cannot be recovered. 67 million is realistic if you think of it as a whole house, and I think it is more severe than a bad prison sentence in terms of actually recovering the money. Even if you pay back 2 million a year, it would be 33 years. Even if the amount of 6.7 billion yen was justified, it would be meaningless, because the owner would not be able to pay such amount after all.",1,1
"Television stations that report these disturbing acts blur the faces of the victims, but in the posted video, of course, the faces are exposed. However, Japanese TV stations are afraid of taking risks and do nothing, whether it is the Unification Church issue or the Johnny's issue. This risk-oriented mindset may be the cause of Japan's Galapagosization.",22,3
"I really think it is the most appropriate opinion. I saw another article that said ""Sushiro's customer traffic did not decrease after the incident, so no damage was done,"" but that is the result of Sushiro's corporate efforts to promptly implement changes in serving methods, etc. as described in this article to restore its credibility, and the writer who says that no damage was done I thought the writer was blind to the world. It is true that backstage work is often looked down upon by those who don't know, but everyone who does it as a job is a professional and is paid by the company for their work. Please don't make fun of them!",1,1
"The judiciary will decide if the amount is reasonable or not. I am not going to mention whether it is high or low. However, it is wrong to think that because this person is a minor, it is easy to forgive him or her, or to put emphasis on nurturing him or her. Companies have employees and shareholders. In this case, the saliva of the boy who caused the incident was unknowingly put into the mouths of others. In a sense, it is not an exaggeration to call it indiscriminate food terrorism. It is only natural that there would be a question of compensation! Parents should accept that they could only educate their children at home not to understand such a simple thing! You shouldn't say that the damage was a drop in sales due to competition from other companies in the same industry, even if that is what your lawyer put you up to. It would be preferable to ask for a reduction on reflection. Even the judiciary will not issue a full damage claim, and Sushiro understands that they can't swing their sleeves back and forth!",1,1
"However, when an adult comedian who has reached a certain age commits a nuisance act, many people defend him or her, saying that the TV station or staff is to blame, or that the senior comedian is to blame. And if they apologize, their favorability rating goes up and no one says anything about the damage or the amount of harm done, so it's a complete ""lose-lose"" situation. Personally, I don't think it's much different from what happened to Sushipero this time, but I guess there are a lot of people who think that ""likability is justice.",3,1
"What is the rehabilitation rate for juvenile crime? What level of rehabilitation do you mean in the first place? A person who used to be a murderer, fights and steals occasionally, but no longer kills people. Is this rehabilitation? I don't mean to sound mean, but I'd rather deal with certainty than the uncertain hope of rehabilitation.",2,1
They are overly sensitive about respecting the privacy of the perpetrators. Japanese police are restricted from excessive arrests and investigations. They are lenient on crimes committed by minors. And the judiciary is lax. These four things are definitely different from other countries. That is why I think there is no end to the number of petty crimes.,7,1
"If it is one or two orders of magnitude different overseas, I would like to see a case study. At least as far as I have been able to find, there have been no cases where a single user has been charged that much. There have been cases in which companies have been charged billions and billions of dollars in compensation, but I think you are mistaking that for a case in which a single user was charged that much.",3,2
"Unsolicited video postings are often made by young people and are a byproduct of ""buzz"" and other fads. The nuisance is spread and evaluated by social networking sites as well as by other (many) companies. I think the reason for the proliferation is that IT legislation has not yet caught up with the situation, so there is little awareness of the crime and it goes unpunished. The current situation of not being able to control (delete) the posts of black market workers is a good example of this. This proves that China is better in this area and that there is nothing they can't do.",1,1
"I think the 67 million lawsuit amount is reasonable. In fact, they won't win the case unless the causal link between Peropero and the loss of stock is completely proven. The actual cost of the measures taken by the store and other stores and the amount of expenses incurred by the lawyers, etc. leading up to the lawsuit would be the amount of the claim.",5,1
"67 million yen. The court will probably order payment at an amount even lower than this. The actual damages will not be that much, and the stock price will have dropped. The number of customers must have taken a hit, even though they were affected by the Corona disaster. You should no longer say that it is because he is a boy.　And if you keep saying that, the parents of the child should be held accountable. That's all they're doing.",2,1
"Good luck, Sushiro! The essence of the incident is that dinner is supposed to be a family affair, but a high school student eating out with bad friends is just too irresponsible of the parents. They will probably not even pay the reimbursement properly. In that case, the three family members should be given severe criminal penalties.",2,1
"Mistakes made by minors in their youth. It is a public assumption, both in Japan and overseas, that this is acceptable. The store's employees will naturally be subject to layoffs and pay cuts, part-time workers will not be able to work even if they want to, and many people will have their lives ruined as a result. The future of the youth is important, but the people who are currently earning their living should not be impoverished as a result. These people have families to protect. It is possible that people may indirectly die as a result of the joke. Are the commentators in the media and information programs taking this into consideration when they speak?",1,1
"It is one thing to be punished and quite another to be compensated for damages. There is no logic in saying that because you have been punished, you do not have to compensate for the damage. It is one thing to forgive an act, and quite another to ask for compensation. When you have caused damage, you deserve to be compensated for it. No matter how the media defends the perpetrator, it does not make sense that he should not be compensated.",1,1
"What happened as a result is the question. Not who. Claims for damages are a given. I don't understand the point of those who are defending the company, and I don't trust them. The stock price plummeted due to this incident, causing a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars, customer traffic decreased because of the filth, they had to deal with the situation and take countermeasures that they should not have had to take, it cost money to build new facilities again, and there are many people at the head office and on the site who are suffering from headaches and stomachaches. Why can't you understand that? This amount of damages is cheap. Even if you file a claim, you will rarely get the full amount when the court actually issues a verdict.",2,1
"I think this news report and the way things turned out may become a benchmark for future ""compensation claims"". 67 million yen may seem like an outrageous amount for an average family, but I think it gave them a chance to learn to be civil and considerate to everyone, not just to companies, and to think before they act. I heard that he feels the seriousness of the situation and is reflecting on it, but I hope he will live his life honestly from now on without being cynical or corrupt.",1,2

"＞This is the most fundamental problem from the standpoint of the human rights and equality of perpetrators. In Japan, the word ""human rights"" is usually used to refer to the perpetrators and the accused, and the human rights of the victims are not mentioned at all. This is because a generous ""defense"" is provided for the perpetrator, and lawyers in general defend the crime from the standpoint of the perpetrator. Victims have no choice but to fight back with civil lawsuits on their own, and the reality is that they are forced to cry themselves to sleep in the face of the hassle and enormous costs involved. In short, the unbelievable thought that it is worse to be the victim of a crime is at the root of this country. It is absolutely ridiculous that the same attitude should be applied to the perpetrators of heinous crimes, who could never be the target of such crimes. It is absolutely ridiculous.",150,2
"In Japan, everything is like this. They say they are forgiving because they are remorseful, or because they are minors and have a future. I guess the media really wanted them not to claim compensation for the damage. They are so concerned about everything that they can only express their regrets to China, South Korea, and North Korea. The government and the media think that the first priority is to avoid conflict. I think the first priority is to find a way to solve the problem, not to avoid it. In this case, I think the amount of money is enough for the perpetrator to pay back for the rest of his/her life.",1,1
"Even though the boy is at fault, they hang him and even charge him compensation. I don't think Japanese society is a decent society if there are many people who support this. They may want to escape from their own reality by hanging those who cannot argue with them and relieve their stress, but the boy is responsible and if he loses the case, he will go bankrupt. As a result, the public will know that they will not get any money for damages, and there will be no deterrent effect.",3,10
"I don't think it is right to defend them because they are old enough to understand what they should not do. The amount of money may be low or high, but rehabilitation is possible. Considering the scale of Sushiro and the damage (including reputational damage), I think the amount is not high at all. On the other hand, if Sushiro had started out with a low amount or had not even filed a lawsuit, I think the public would have criticized Sushiro for its low awareness of food hygiene.",2,1
"I think the article really states the right thing. The self-proclaimed ""ethereal liberals"" and the media who defend the perpetrators are just making seemingly cool and irresponsible statements, putting themselves outside the issue. If you are going to make such statements, why don't you donate to Sushiro, the victim, from your own wallet? Not only this incident, but similar crimes are occurring frequently in restaurants. I think that the amount of compensation should be in excess of 100 million yen to serve as a wake-up call to the public.",3,2
"I think this author seems to be missing the point of view one way or another. Why was no effort made to contain what the minors had done so that the damage would not be as great as possible, while at the same time warning them? Who among the adults intentionally made a big deal out of it and increased the damage? Does it make sense to demand compensation for the enormous (alleged) damage as if the boy were responsible for it all? I think this is the point of contention. If the boy were to be compensated alone, he would have to make a living while paying additional tax and social insurance premiums for the disposable income of 67 million yen (after deducting tax and social insurance premiums). Why didn't we do something about it before such a situation arose? I think it is the responsibility of adults to look back and think about what can be done, even if it is too late.",2,1
"I don't know what the benefit is to those who defend it, but I think there is a minority of opinions defending it. They are just overreacting because they are making a big deal out of it. I think this Sushiro case is a good opportunity to think about how risky the nuisance is. Good luck to Sushiro!",3,2
"Japanese law is indeed lenient. It's so lenient that it makes me sick to my stomach. But even if the amount of damages is raised, the perpetrator will not be able to pay. Tens of millions of yen is appropriate. Even if an order for payment of tens of millions of yen is issued, if the assailant does not pay, it will not amount to anything, and there is a high possibility that the assailant will not have to pay. There is a statute of limitations on compensation orders, and once that statute expires, the perpetrator is no longer obligated to pay. Japanese law is based on the principle of ""hate the crime, hate the person.",1,2
"The only way to do this is to install cameras inside the store, which will honestly capture the situation, and there will be no more evidence, and it will also prevent problems with customers inside the store.",1,1
"He and his parents apologized, but I think it's only natural that they said no. There are things that are right and wrong in this world. It is a problem that only an apology will suffice after causing billions of yen of trouble to people in various ways. In other countries, they would probably charge billions of dollars. I think they must be a little bit Showa in their senses to make them work for it.",1,1
"I agree with you about the state of mass media reporting. There may be restrictions on reporting on the perpetrators, but sometimes the only information we get is from the police. However, the victims are reported without regard to their privacy. If they don't have a photo of the victim, they even find a photo from a graduation album. Since the Privacy Protection Law does not apply to the deceased, anything is possible. If the time is a little too late, they don't even mention it. All they care about is business.",3,1
"100,000 per month, to be paid for life. I wonder if there will be a ruling like that. If he is a minor, his parents may be able to pay it, but it is a very painful amount. If they fail to pay, even if they foreclose, it is not an amount of money that would make their life extremely difficult. Even if you have 70 years left in your life, it is 84 million. I know it's not enough at all from the corporate side, but I think it's good for them to be reminded for the rest of their lives without being able to escape.",1,2
"A lot of things, that's it, this is it, this is it. It's bad enough that the liberal press is defending the perpetrators all together. It is not the role of the media to judge punishment before defending the perpetrators. The bullying issue shows where the argument that the perpetrator has a future is leading. As for Sushiro, they will claim compensation (though it is cheap), and it is the court that will judge that, and it is another person who will think about the future of the perpetrator. So where is the relief for the victims? This is what happens when the media treats all those things together.",1,1
"It's not just the Sushiro case, but every time there is a crime in the news, the victim's privacy, home, family, work, everything is exposed, while the perpetrator is protected by a mosaic... there is something wrong with Japan.",1,1
"Do you really think they would feel remorse if they willingly and happily did something like that? A juvenile is... let's say, a high school student, old enough to know what not to do. It's not good to treat him like a child, and there's no way he'll ever be rehabilitated. People don't change that much. Prevention of recurrence and victims should be the first priority.",4,1
"The boy's mischievous behavior was a blunder, of course, but the scale of the crime is much larger than that of the boy. The boy's unthinking prank is the problem, of course, but I'm a little angry that he's not responsible for making the crime bigger and more flamboyant and destroying the boy's life just for the entertainment of it.",5,2
"I feel that it is difficult to expect rehabilitation in this day and age. Wisdom is wickedness, and cleverness is cunning....rehabilitation cannot be expected.",2,1
"The fact that punitive damages have not been adopted in Japan is rather advantageous for companies. Punitive damages are imposed to deter similar acts in the future, so individuals are not covered. If this is the case, then Sushiro should be compensated about 10 billion yen to prevent them from doing so in the future.",1,1
"If this were in the U.S., the home of stock capitalism, ""silent shareholders"" would have formed a group of plaintiffs and filed a lawsuit demanding compensation for losses caused by the decline in stock prices, and the plaintiffs would have been awarded billions of yen.",1,1
"As per this article, it is often said that there is room for rehabilitation for minors, but I would like to see statistics on how many minors are really rehabilitated and how those who are rehabilitated are able to contribute to society in concrete terms. If it is low, then we need to improve the rehabilitation programs of rehabilitation agencies, and we can also show that there are individual problems that cannot be solved by themselves. Or it can be made clear as to whether or not they are responsible. The mental age of an 18-year-old and a 20-year-old should not be that different. I don't care if they are in elementary school, but you are too lenient on minors.",3,1
"It's really as the article says. In any case, Japan (the media?) tends to defend the perpetrators too much. tends to protect the perpetrators too much. The victim's face is exposed, but the perpetrator's is mosaicked. I don't get it. There is no need for the victim to help the assailant to rehabilitate himself, and there is no room for sympathy. Sushiro's compensation claim may be 67 million yen, but the drop in stock price is 16 billion yen. And Sushiro is not the only one affected. The people who held Sushiro's shares have also suffered a tremendous loss. There must have been people who lost their lives because of this. So why should we sympathize with or defend the perpetrators? Would you be able to sympathize with and defend them if you had suffered the same fate?",3,2
"TV and celebrities are basically out of touch and dull, so people from now on need to acquire knowledge and education by themselves in a proper forum. The public who paid for the restaurant and the food are the victims, and those who uploaded the nuisances to social networking sites are declaring war on the whole nation by presenting their criminal acts, so it is only natural that they should be caught and punished. I think that the people affected by the crime deserve to be caught and punished.",1,1
"I really hope the companies do their best. If they do this for fun and games, it's a joke. If it's a small business, they will cry themselves to sleep. It can be done away with with a single confectionary box. Let's all learn from this case. Doing the wrong thing can be a big problem. It could break up a family, and you should know what it means to go bankrupt. The only way to get it approved is to pay it off first. This is why cases like this happen because people don't know that.",3,1
"This article makes sense in this article. On the other hand, Sushiro is a company that has engaged in quite a bit of fraudulent behavior with their hype. We hope that they will be fined or have their compensation reduced to 67 million yen per board member for their own fraudulent acts as well. If they are going to be tough on juveniles, they should also be tough on their own people.",1,1
"I also watched the morning show where Kazushige Nagashima spoke. He said that they should be made to work as dishwashers, but my simple question was, ""How many hours do they have to work to get the 67 million yen worth of work? and ""Will they feel comfortable working together with the Sushiro employees who are the victims? I have heard that in other countries there are judicial decisions to clean parks, etc. (I don't know if there actually are), but I thought that this is just a judicial decision to have them perform service at public facilities, and the victims are not involved. Why should the victim have to take care of the perpetrator's rehabilitation as well? I think this is a plausible opinion.",1,1
"I am not at all inclined to defend these perpetrators. I think they should be charged a much higher compensation to deter recurrence. ＞I don't understand why you only defend the perpetrators...<Who is the perpetrator, who is the victim, what did the perpetrator do and what loss did he cause to the victim. ・・・・・ If you understand the basics, I don't think you would defend the perpetrators.",2,1
"I think they want to defend the perpetrator and pride themselves as a generous person with deep pockets. I wonder how they would feel if they were victims of a similar crime, albeit on a different scale, and suffered damage that affected their financial and social credibility. Would you be as forgiving of the perpetrator?",1,1
"＞In the case of the ""Sushiro"" case, he is reported to have spoken about the rehabilitation of the juvenile, saying, ""It is one way to have the juvenile do menial, or backstage work,"" and ""From the perspective of nurturing and educating the juvenile (if Sushiro helps rehabilitate him), it will enhance his image. It is true that it is important to rehabilitate the perpetrators, but I think they do not get public support because they talk only about the rehabilitation and future of the perpetrators while the compensation for the victims is inadequate. Not only in this case, but for example, even if a crime victim claims compensation from the perpetrator and wins the case, he or she actually gets very little money because the other party often has no property. There are crime victims' benefits, but depending on the case, that may not cover the costs at all. Some might argue that they should pay more money to do so, but it is difficult to expand the program because the funding source is taxpayer money. Some people will argue why the public's tax money should be used to pay for what the perpetrator has done. In the end, the most effective way is to punish one offender with 100 punishments.",2,1
"If I make them an order of magnitude more compensation in the first place, will they pay it? I have a feeling that they would not be willing to work hard to pay it back and would give up from the start. What are the recovery rates in other countries? If possible, I'd like to see the recovery rate multiplied by the compensation and compare it to what the perpetrator actually paid.",2,1
"Japanese penalties are lenient. Defending a crime, I'm sure he will recover, or a momentary lapse, or maybe he is still a child. but all crimes are crimes. That's why there are laws. Were you mentally responsible at the time? I often ask. People like that don't commit crimes. They do it because they don't have it. There should be stricter penalties and guidance so that they cannot commit a mistake again. Today, more and more people are committing crimes with ease. It's time to update everything, or Japan could become the worst country in the world.",1,1
"I honestly thought they were going to charge me in the hundreds of millions of dollars. This amount of money would be totally lenient and sweet. I thought it was a resolute company's attitude that minors have some aspects of being underage that they use as a weapon to get by, and that it won't get through (but it's cheap). I can only imagine that those who defend these things have something backward about themselves.",2,2
"I was thinking that 67 million yen is, well, very Japanese. For example, if the damage was caused by a small sushi restaurant, they might say that the cost of soy sauce and fish was about 1,000 yen. It is impossible to ask for restoration to the status quo, and even the minimum necessary is not allowed. In the end, for some reason, Japanese law is perpetrator-first, so the perpetrator gets the most benefit.",4,1
"Sushiro has not yet called it a done deal. They have announced that they may add more. The parties are still discussing. Furthermore, even if the compensation is large, it may not be enough to cover all the damages. If the perpetrator gives up on repayment and dies, there will be no compensation. Balance is important. We have no choice but to remain silent and watch.",1,1
"Since when? When the perpetrator's face and vehicle license plate number are mosaicked to make it difficult to identify the perpetrator, even though it is obvious that he is committing a crime or a nuisance. The privacy of the victim is exposed, but the privacy of the perpetrator is protected. It's a strange world we live in now, isn't it? Even if a person commits a murder, he or she is still considered to be responsible for the crime. It is just not right to give priority to the human rights of the perpetrators and suspects.",5,1
"There is one perpetrator, but the victims are the many employees who have suffered losses. And some of those employees may have children about the same age as Mr. Pelorist. Whether it's 600 million or 60 million, Mr. Pelorist will not be able to pay it off, and even if he could, it would be a long time before he could pay it off. However, if we as a society do not show that there is a great deal of responsibility that comes with the pranks, there will be second and third pedophiles, and the number of victims will increase. I think severe punishment is necessary to prevent such victims.",1,1
"There was a problem in the past with posting pranks in convenience stores, such as lying on ice cream freezers. If we don't think of ways to apply the lessons learned in the past to the future, it is likely to happen again in a few years. I feel sorry for the companies.",1,2
"It is criminal punishment to consider rehabilitation or advocacy for a minor. As for compensation claims (civil), the main actor is the victim, and if the claim is justified, it should be paid by someone (including relatives) for the rest of his/her life. Of course, there may be preferential installments, interest rates, and terms based on the ability to pay, but there should never be a write-off. The mass media should understand (and reflect on) the fact that Japan has a lot of ""getaways"" (i.e., ability to pay), and as a result, it encourages crime (the same applies to the problem of black-market part-timers and the recipients of bank transfer fraud). I believe that many of the people in Japan are now aware that these crimes are no longer the cute little crimes that they used to be forgiven for because they were minors.",1,2
"This annoying video seemed to have been picked up by foreign news outlets, and pro-Japanese YouTubers were all over it. Many commented that it has had a considerable impact not only in Japan, but also on foreign conveyor-belt sushi chain restaurants and those who are considering opening new restaurants overseas. I understand that it is important to consider the punishment of minors with rehabilitation, but I believe that true atonement must come first. If we do not firmly show that we are responsible for our actions and that we will make them pay for the trouble they cause, I feel that there will be more and more cases like this in the future. I think it is important for children, parents, and society to seriously consider the merits and demerits of SNS and create a system to address them.",2,1
"Performance deteriorated due to this incident. As a result, there may be part-timers and part-timers who were laid off. Their lives may have been severely damaged. With such possibilities, 67 million is a small price to pay. With terrorist acts like this being reported for years, there is no excuse for getting carried away or being a prankster. I think they should be required to pay for the damages as a deterrent to future acts of stupidity.",2,1
"You can charge billions and billions of dollars, but you won't get it anyway. They don't have the ability to pay. It's just a performance. If they were to charge 15 billion yen for a stock price that had fallen, there is a possibility that people would feel sympathy for the boy. I think it would be much tougher to charge the limit of what they can realistically pay.",1,1
"I was getting dizzy looking at the flowery people who mistakenly think that ""I am kind enough to extend a helping hand to anyone and everything,"" saying that this charge is too severe for an ordinary family because of a mere lick. There are too many people who don't understand how much damage that little lick can do, how much damage it can cause to Japan's food culture and restaurants, and how much it threatens the livelihood of the people who work at those places.",5,1
"I agree with this article. Liberal politicians and journalists often protect one side or the other under the guise of ""feeling sorry for them,"" but I have been wondering what is wrong with that. I think that this case and the confusion caused by the revision of the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act have the same root, and it is not as simple as ""I feel sorry for them"".",2,1
"Since I was a child, when I misbehaved and caused trouble, I was told that if all I had to do was to say sorry, there would be no need for the police. I was told, ""If you're sorry, there's no need for the police. I think the media should not judge what is right or wrong, but only tell the facts.",10,1
"If you are in a position to have a lot of employees, it is not easy to forgive a company you have nurtured and built up, and it will cost you a lot of money to rebuild it. It's not worth taking up the opinions of a monkish commentator who only thinks on the spot. Rehabilitation as a part-timer in the back office, where trust is so important? What? Who would want to go to a restaurant where that boy works? It may be unfortunate to make an example of him, but he should be punished severely to prevent a recurrence.",4,2
"I don't think there is any mercy in the charges because they are still trying to get away with such foolishness even after all the talk about it, but I think this sentiment comes from the fact that the compensation is to an individual and the victim is a for-profit company. If the company actually went out of business, I would not say so, but if the punishment is strictly enforced in an industry that is a major source of income, it might be said that this is not so. The Japanese have a strict code of conduct, but at the same time, they have a virtue of ""hate the crime, hate the person,"" so they are lax on punishment, or at worst, they make arrangements as if the crime had never happened. In the old days, kicking and punching used to be a part of the punishment, but nowadays, such punishments have been denied and people often get a taste of it by not getting hurt. The truth is that this is what is keeping these crimes of moral decay from being eradicated.",2,1
"I thought it was in the hundreds of millions, but it is not an amount that cannot be paid back if you work your whole life. Of course, they will not be able to live like other people until the money is paid back. Let them realize the gravity of what they have done.",1,1
"I think this amount of money is a threat to make an example of them and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. There are certainly those who say that in other countries, but this is Japan, so I think they will drop it drastically. There is no such thing as seizing all wages until all assets are paid off, which would be the only way to live or die. There are those who would like to see this kind of thing happen.",4,4
"Sushiro's damage is not that great, and the media is practically complicit in making that damage worse. The reason it has spread so widely is that the major media has picked up on it, and I'm sure other countries wouldn't have been able to get away with such a realistic amount of money, which is still quite a concession, but the media is picking up on everything, and the companies can't back down.",2,1
"I thought, ""67 million...even if the parents were to pay, it would be even more difficult for a family with a blonde like that to pay, since their ability to pay is probably below average."" I thought to myself, ""I'd like to get rid of this underage prank. I would like to let it go as a minor's prank, but I think there will be people who will play this kind of game in the future if we respond in such a way. I think that in order for people to be able to eat out in peace, we need to make an example of them. We need to let them know that they are not allowed to do it.",1,2
"When this incident was making a big deal, I casually asked my 3-year-old son if he wanted to go to Sushiro, and he said he didn't like it because of Peropero. I asked my 3 year old son casually if he wanted to go to Sushiro, and he said he didn't like it because of Peropero.",2,1
"I feel that many young people these days are smart. Personally, I never imagined that I would be interested in the law when I was a minor, and that I would use it to my advantage in the event of an emergency. I know that today's young people would say, ""That's stupid,"" but for me, I have no regrets at all. On the contrary, I want to tell them. Is it worthwhile to live a life filled with such wiles? The wiles get the better of you, and you consciously cause incidents like this. There is no disclosure of personal information because you are a minor. Even if it is recognized as a crime, no significant penalty will be imposed. What kind of rehabilitation is ""meaningful to the world"" for a person who has acquired this kind of mindset in the underage generation? The life of a bad person has already started. On the other hand, I think the older a person gets after adulthood, the more willing he or she is to be rehabilitated. The theory that you can be rehabilitated just because you have a lot of time left doesn't hold true in the 21st century.",1,3
"Japan is really lenient on criminals, especially minors who are treated under the Juvenile Law. Rehabilitation and punishment should be considered separately. Before rehabilitation, the offender must first be made aware of the crime committed and be adequately punished. This is the law of society for thinking creatures (for everyone to live in fairness, justice, peace, and freedom).",7,1
"The way this article handles the case, I think it fits well. I think it's a little too childish to think that the young people versus a big company is a case of goodwill in a restaurant, but when you convert it to goodwill, it becomes the opposite... I know you want to tell the big company to show their pocketbooks, but to the people who make their living at this company, I think it's a joke. The people who make their living at these companies would say, ""You've got to be kidding me.",8,1
"I don't think they are defending him, but rather just tempering an attack that has gone too far in tone. I have never seen anyone say that they don't need to be punished in any way. They are just cutting out the words and interpreting them in their own convenient way. Comparing only the amount of money or the way of doing things with foreign countries is also not a very meaningful thought. And it is usually the United States. The scale is totally different, and there is no point in comparing. This is just another result of trying to force consistency in their opinions. There is no rationality. I think that is the reason why I am here.",2,1
"Basically, if we add up the cost of cleaning and replacing the fixtures, the labor costs for the employees required to do this, the loss of external reputation as a company, defamation, etc., the lawsuit will be in the hundreds of millions, and we have to let the courts decide what to do with it. Regardless of the outcome, I believe that the resolute stance of the victims and sanctions against the perpetrators will prevent such ridiculous crimes from occurring in the future. Still, I recommend that you not take any action against a former baseball player and TV personality who sells stupidity. It will only lower the author's standing.",3,1
"The same judgment should be given to the photographer (and the contributor). In addition, the parties involved (like those at the table) should also be charged a few million yen, since such bullying could be rampant. In the meantime, the parents of the boy who made this famous should sue the contributors, even 30% would reduce the amount by 20 million. Maybe the photographer is a parent? I don't think so, do you?",1,1
"If a Japanese person is sued in a foreign country and has to pay a large amount of compensation, what will the Japanese media and wide shows say about it in their broadcasts and weekly newsletters? Japan has a lenient attitude toward compensation, and I don't think they can say anything in defense of the perpetrator, because if you do something wrong, you are liable for compensation.",2,1
"As has always been the case, in Japan, even if the victim claims for damages, in the end the victim cannot claim the full amount and has to cry himself to sleep, in Japan, the perpetrator is protected more than the victim, and even by global standards, the judiciary is an anomaly, because Japan is a criminal-friendly country, crime will not go away.",7,1
"If the basic thesis is that the adults in the neighborhood are involved in raising children, then the neighborhood stores that children go to should also help raise children. Before criticizing this matter, I think you should reconfirm your own stance on child-rearing.",2,3
"Sushiro and Kurazushi have touch panels on their seats, so it would be a good idea to inform people that such an act is a crime, wouldn't it? If there had been an incident such as poison being mixed into sushi, it would not have been a prank, and considering the future of public safety in Japan, it would have been necessary to take measures sooner or later. It can't be said that the store was not at fault either.",2,5
"This author's title says that he is a reportage writer, but this article is not reportage. It is a complete position talk without a shred of objectivity. It is nothing more than writing about your own ""severe punishment for the Peropero boys"" argument, along with the fake testimonies that suit it. You are free to write any article you want, but you should not call yourself a reportage writer.",1,2
"No matter how much he may have done on a spur of the moment and without thought, it does not change the fact that he did it. He should make amends while reflecting on what he did. Parents should reaffirm the importance of discipline and education, and live their lives helping each other with a sense of responsibility. We should not fight over the consequences of what we have done....",1,1
"The amount of damage caused by the video was about 17 billion yen in stock price alone, right? The 67 million yen is quite a concession by Sushiro. I thought they would just say, ""Okay, we'll pay it,"" but I heard the perpetrators are saying they are going to fight about the amount of the claim. They seem to be saying that the reason the number of customers has gone away is due in part to the influence of competing stores. If a child is a child, then a parent is a parent, and I take it that you have no remorse. Maybe they are getting carried away because they have someone to defend them.",1,2
"They probably had no idea of the serious consequences of their prank by releasing the video to the public. The situation could not be dismissed as a youthful indiscretion, and now that it has become irreversible, he must take responsibility and come to terms with his actions.",3,1
"I think what Mr. Nagashima said was to awaken his awareness that it is not good to do such things through diligent work, let alone in the food and beverage industry. I think what Mr. Nagashima said was to awaken his awareness of the importance of working diligently, not only to the restaurant industry, but also to his own self awareness of the importance of working diligently. I don't think he was trying to make fun of the dishwasher's work as a menial job. I think the contractor's claim of 67 million yen is correct. If they don't do it, it would be treasonous to the rest of the restaurant industry.",1,1
"I am fed up with TV that doesn't give a straight answer and gives anti-government and anti-social views in the name of liberalism. They are so bad, not realizing that they are making the world a worse place. I hope that radio auctions will be introduced and that radio waves, which are common property, will be used properly.",3,1
"There used to be a rapper who said that perpetrators have human rights too, and I would like to say that by such people, perpetrators are more and more protected that even if they are caught, they should not be caught as if they are in pain, but how can the pain in the heart of the victim not be filled?",3,1
"The foreign digits are different! I can't say for sure, because it is a punitive measure, but the defendants have lawyers on their side, and they say that the amount is too big, so they have no choice but to fight! The defendant has lawyers on their side, and they are going to fight the case, so I guess they have no choice but to fight. I don't know if I would take care of him that much, though. I don't think so. It reminds me of the case of a privately owned buckwheat noodle shop in the Kanto area that was forced to close a few years ago because of a byte terrorist attack. After the settlement was reached, the part-timers never showed up and the restaurant was closed! I thought to myself, this time it's a chain store. I hope it's not just this boy, but also a punitive measure! I guess.",16,1
"I forget what incident it was the other day, but there was a time when NHK was reporting face to face, but Fuji TV was putting up a mosaic. In Fuji's case, they put mosaics on almost everything. I don't know if they are protecting themselves or the human rights of criminals, but those committing crimes should be reported with their faces shown. There is no need to put mosaic even on the faces of criminals who are robbing people. The media's excessive protection of criminals that leads to this article is questionable.",2,1
"TV Asahi is not defending the boy in this matter. It is that Kazushige Nagashima, a second-generation TV personality who has never worked in society, made an ignorant and ill-informed comment. The program was summed up by the comment that the boy must pay for his crime, so it would be wrong to lead the liberal media to believe that he was protecting the boy from this comment. It is understandable that you are upset with Nagashima's opinion, but if that is the case, you should direct your anger at Nagashima alone.",1,1
"When I first heard the price of 67 million, I thought it was cheap. But when I thought about it, I realized that it was also a very realistic price. But then I thought about it and realized that it was also a very realistic amount. The Japanese judiciary will probably reduce the amount significantly from the amount offered anyway, but from what I have seen so far, if the compensation is just what the parents can scrape together and pay, the child will assume that the case is over without much pain, so even if the amount is reduced, I hope the trial will be concluded with a fractional amount rounded down. Well, this child is probably in a lot of pain at this point...",1,2
"People who cry out for the rights, future, and rehabilitation of perpetrators must be kind-hearted people who, for example, do not take the risk that they or their family might be stung when wasps start to build nests under the eaves of their houses and remove the nests, saying ""wasps are doing their best to survive"" and ""wasps have the right to live, too. I guess he is a kind-hearted person who does not remove the nests.",20,4
"This case is not a case of hurting anyone, and it is not malicious, but a small prank by a child should not make a grown man crush a young man with a bright future. We need to be tolerant enough to tolerate it as a youthful indiscretion.",2,25
"They say they are sorry, but I wonder what they are sorry about, such as the fact that they have lost customers due to competition with other stores that have actually been sued. I don't see any sincerity in the fact that the lawyer simply comes out and says he is sorry and says he is sorry about how much damage this industry has suffered and how many people's lives have been ruined by his actions simply to get his own temporary acceptance. I don't see anywhere in the article that he has already sold his home and is using the money for compensation? I wonder what part of this is remorseful.",3,1
"It is not just one company that has been damaged, but the entire conveyor-belt sushi industry. As the boy's lawyers have indicated, other companies have experienced a decline in customer traffic as well, and this incident is the cause of that decline. Some celebrities have said that it would be easy to have the boy do the dishes and clean up, but that is impossible for the boy who caused this incident. I think the compensation will be an order of magnitude less.",1,1
"Japan is a country governed by the rule of law, but there are many people who consider this bizarre because there are many people who want to judge individuals without leaving it to the judiciary, people who release personal information on social networking sites, people who search for such information, people who make perpetrators into victims. If there were no voices to defend this boy, this country would be incredibly scary.",1,1
">Dishwashing and cleaning are really important jobs. >I would be willing to say it is the most important. >There is no more difficult job if you are serious about it as a professional and a craftsman. It's a job that many restaurants leave to the lowest level, part-timers, and machines. Of course, dishes in high-end restaurants are expensive and have to be handled carefully, but still, in restaurants where many people work, the head chef doesn't wash dishes. You use the phrase ""any job is difficult if you really put your mind to it,"" but it's this kind of outlandish accusation that makes some people come to my defense. In the first place, there is ""why defend only the perpetrators,"" but if anyone dares to defend, it is the perpetrators. Victims are not to blame, so there is no need to defend them. In a criminal trial, a ""defense attorney"" is assigned to a suspect, but no one would say, ""Why are only the perpetrators defended? No one would say, ""Why are only the perpetrators defended? Because they are the ones accused of the crime, they are defended.",2,1
"I don't trust people who take pictures like this or who talk about foreign countries. The person who drew the logo for the Olympics also posed like this, but I am now convinced that I knew it. I want there to be a law that clearly states that what is not liked is not liked, and what is allowed or not allowed is allowed or not allowed, before it becomes a matter of who or what country.",1,1
"I think a society that can consider the future and rehabilitation of juvenile offenders is a good society. However, the basic premise of such a society is that the victims do not cry themselves to sleep. The victim must take full responsibility for what he or she has done. Then rehabilitation. We must not misunderstand the order.",2,1
"Western society is a contract society based on the social contract. If a customer is disadvantaged, he or she is entitled to a reasonable amount of compensation, and astronomical figures are not uncommon. In Japan, on the other hand, people are less contract-conscious and tend to be more sympathetic and emotional.",4,1
"I wonder what the punitive damages would be when a certain restaurant in the U.S. runs a ""half-price beer, no matter how many drinks you have"" campaign and then runs out of beer right after opening, and the customers claim damages for lost opportunity or fraud or something. It can't just be the CEO's sorry. This is what happens when you forget that you are not only defending the perpetrators, but that you yourself have done a lot of things that have caused customers to lose confidence in you. They should not be the only ones who are victims.",1,1
"67 million is cheap. As a hypothetical example, 20s - average monthly income 250,000 x 10 years = 30 million 30s - average monthly income 300,000 x 10 years = 36 million 40s - average monthly income 350,000 x 10 years = 42 million 50s - average monthly income 400,000 x 10 years = 48 million 60s - average monthly income 300,000 x 10 years = 36 million lifetime income 19,200 million approximately 30 The % compensation is not high at all. Rather, depending on how you work, you can afford it. Since you have been compensated, you cannot make lame excuses like ""I can't make money"" or ""I won't get paid that much"" and not think about earning money based on what you can't do. It would be better to work double or triple jobs while your parents are still alive, when you don't need the money yet, to raise the amount of repayment. Even marriage and child rearing will be done in the future.",1,1
"Just get out of TV sponsorship. People don't change until they can't eat. It would be a reasonable damage award to let the boy know that he did just that. If we coddle them like the media is arguing, they will never become decent members of society. The leftist media cannot hold power when society is orderly and stable. They can seize power when society is disordered and people are suspicious of each other, so they make up false discrimination and disparities and take advantage of the socially vulnerable.",2,1
"The reason it's so expensive overseas is because the SNS platformer is also held jointly and severally liable, right? In Japan, it's just the advertisers, or maybe it's because they're making money by making it available to idiots, even though it's all about personal responsibility. If there is a murder case with a kitchen knife, is the kitchen knife maker responsible? You might argue, ""Is the knifemaker responsible if a murder is committed with a kitchen knife? However, social networking and video diffusion, just like guns and other weapons, require the selection of people who use them. Regulations should be imposed on platformers who make money under the cover of personal morals but do not take responsibility, and the media who take their side.",1,1
"The essence of this series of unsolicited videos is not so much the filthy act itself, but the act of filming and posting the videos on social media. I think it would be better to focus on that in the trial and in the press. The biggest problem is that the spread of smartphones and social networking services has not kept pace with the development of laws and guidance for children.",1,2
">>A former student of the author, who worked part-time at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant when he was a student, said, ""There should be more. The amount of compensation is also in focus, but the biggest problem in Japan is the slow movement of politicians on these matters. How long has the law been in place? As long as the internet illiterate grandpa continues to be a politician or a minister, Japan will continue to lag behind in the system and will not be able to keep up with the times.",1,1
"Or rather, the media, the government, and the judiciary are too lenient toward children. They know this, so they do whatever they want. Apologizing is all they need to do. If an adult gets angry at them, they resent the adult and say that the adult who got angry at them violated them and make the person who got angry at them the bad guy. I want you to stop doing things just to protect them. I want them to be able to judge whether something is wrong or not, and to know that what is wrong is wrong. You should punish them the same way you would an adult, without protecting them.",2,1
"The argument that ""Japan is a different country from the rest of the world, and the market is different, so that's how it is in Japan! Personally, I like the idea of ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and triple payback! Personally, I like the ""eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, triple payback!",1,1
"Honestly, why 67 million yen? I thought, too cheap. The fact that he is a juvenile or a minor has nothing to do with the amount of compensation. If the reason is because he is a minor, the guardian should just take responsibility, because this compensation is directed to the family that raised such an insane child. And the company has an image, in fact, it doesn't matter if it's 1 billion or 2 billion yen, but they dared to set it at 67 million yen (an amount that is not that impossible~).",2,1
"This is a country that really only caters to the perpetrators. Why can't victims and others who have done nothing to be saved? There are victim's associations, so why don't they form an association for the rehabilitation of the perpetrators and let the perpetrators do it themselves? If sushipero compensation is also awarded for a small amount, then a new law should be made.",7,2
">This is such a difficult job if you are serious about it as a craftsman If you raise the bar so high, there will be no one left to do it. In my own experience, newcomers were trained to do the work, starting with washing dishes and sweeping floors. They would not be able to pay tens of millions of yen anyway, and if no one would hire them, the amount they could pay would be very small. I wonder if the intention is to make an example of them, so they don't reach out to us.",1,1
"I can't go out to eat if I think about bite terrorism. I haven't gone out to eat for years. I will never go out to eat out again. This Perot incident is going to be the standard for these types of incidents. Bite terrorism is also neat, please. I'm too scared to go out to eat in this world.",1,1
"Like the Perot boy, the adults who defend him who are old enough have a severe lack of imagination, and when they are actually harmed, they often turn into people who turn their palms up and attack him fiercely. I think he will be protected by those unfortunate people who cannot even think about the victim's position and cannot look at the situation objectively from a bird's eye view.",1,1
"I always wonder why people who self-identify as liberals, both meth media and politicians, are so biased in their opinions to only help the perpetrators.　That is not liberal.　I think they say they respect minority opinions just to oppose the opinions of the majority.　Liberals do not exist in Japan.",3,2
"I think you've been watching too many old human-interest dramas about letting people help out at the restaurant without paying. If it were me, I would think that it is a joke to let the person who has given me trouble into the restaurant. I would never want to see their faces again. I feel angry that helping people or doing welfare work has become a form of purification.",1,1
"I don't understand what you are defending. What if the position were your own company? It would be the same logic as saying that the boy with the black market job should be rehabilitated at the store he robbed, but the only way to be forgiven is to atone and pay for the crime first. I am surprised that there are people who think it is someone else's problem and say shallow things.",1,1
"Apparently, there are quite a few people saying that this is ""not mature,"" but all stores are incurring unexpected additional costs due to losses when they are once closed (closed) or due to operational changes such as how they are offered. I'm just wondering who is going to bear these costs. Can you say that you won't claim for damages because it's ""not mature"" if it's done to your company or store?",1,1
"I know it's only a bill, so it's probably going to be in the millions, but if you can't pay even that, I'd say don't do it in the first place. No, paying money doesn't mean you can do it, but paying that much is still too cheap considering the trouble you've caused others.",8,1
"In Japan, one can be what is commonly referred to as a ""good boy"" as long as he pretends to have a view of the weak rather than a sense of morality and justice.

"You may say that this is a ""bad image,"" but until recently, conveyor-belt sushi was a type of business in which products were passed around in front of many customers with the product exposed, and from the beginning it had only an image of being unclean. And I think it is irresponsible to leave condiments on the table, and not just at conveyor-belt sushi restaurants. That's not to say that it's okay to lick the soy sauce spout, but I can't shake my distrust of the industry's attitude of playing the victim 100% of the time, while ignoring the part where they were at fault.",2,2
"67 million is cheap, Sushiro's damage is enormous, sushi is served to order 🟰 employee augmentation, no pakri of delicious spinning sushi 🟰 sales decline, low stock price 🟰 shareholder detriment,.... I think it's Sushiro's conscience.",151,6
"To be frank, I think there is little chance of rehabilitation. I think this boy will just try to forget rather than be sorry for what he did. If someone died in front of him or something, he would probably stop caring a little, but if his parents are making this kind of compensation, he won't be sorry for anything. I think they will do it again even if they receive some kind of sanction. I think that's the kind of person he is from the start. I don't think that the naive and flowery things we do nowadays will work with young people. Let them go to jail. I think they will understand the happiness of being free.",1,1
"It's not just the stores. Some people have lost their jobs because of this, and affiliated companies have seen their business plummet, and if they own stock, they lose their assets due to the drop in market value.",6,1
"So, the bullying and the like will never go away, and the drop in stock prices and sales is not their fault, but just because customers went outside. I don't think they realize the gravity of the situation.",2,2
"The important thing is to handle the matter under the due process of law. This country is too ""emotional"". If we don't come to a world in which the courts are more concerned with making proper judgments, we will remain a country that wastes time with emotional arguments. We should come to realize that the reason for the low ""productivity"" in this country is the lack of strictly enforced ""mechanisms"" and ""systems"". It makes sense to settle this issue through a court case.",2,2
"The affected companies are spending a lot of money and time not only to damage their image, but also to prevent a recurrence. And since sales at all stores are not expected to increase during the period of measures, it is a small price to pay from the victim's point of view, isn't it? (Even if we take into account that the perpetrators are also customers.)",2,1
"Why would the victim be further victimized? There are many people who have an argument that is incomprehensible. Many of them don't think from the victim's point of view. Before commenting, I think you should stop and consider how it feels to be on the victim's side. Also, Japanese law is almost in a ""you get what you pay for"" state. It is perfectly understandable to encourage rehabilitation, but what about whipping the victim for that? Even for free, if you get hit, not only will you not be fully compensated, but you will only get a sparrow's eye. In this case, too, the company is claiming a reduction of more than 15.9 billion yen despite the fact that it caused more than 16 billion yen in damages in terms of the market value of its stock. I think that the full amount of the claim plus the cost of countermeasures would have been enough. Isn't such a legal revision necessary? Whatever the case may be, they are still saying that they did not intend to spread the video because they intended to share it among their friends. It is clear that he has no remorse, so I think he should be given a slap on the wrist.",2,1
"I cannot agree with Kazushige Nagashima and others that washing dishes is acceptable. This is an act that could destroy the credibility of the restaurant industry from the bottom up, and if it is taken lightly, there will be a lot of copycats. I think they should be made an example of to some extent. But it is not for outsiders like us (including commentators) to say whether it is light or heavy. Let's leave it to the judiciary.",1,1
"In that sense, factors other than the act itself are involved, and the boy's part of the burden seems to be partial. I don't know, but it seems that the damage caused by the person who took the picture, the person who posted it, and the person who spread it is being aggregated and put on one person's shoulders.",1,1
"TV commentators are ignorant of the world and say whatever they want based on their own sensibilities. The former baseball player mentioned in the article has done nothing but play baseball, and even his baseball career is not top-notch, thanks to his parents' support. The comedian who had an affair with a multi-purpose toilet at the Toyosu market also said something like that. Do people who appear on TV take physical labor and the work behind the scenes lightly? Then it makes sense that ADs are not treated like human beings.",3,1
"For the record, I think it's a small price to pay. The original loss should not be like this. It seems to me that the common-sense price is even more believable. Still, it is not an amount that an average person can afford to pay. The decision is judicial, but is the perpetrator ready to accept it?",1,1
"Since it is a civil case, not a criminal one, the defendant only seeks compensation for the damages incurred, and since there is no punitive intent, there is no system to say that the amount is reduced because of the juvenile offense.",2,1
"It is natural to defend the victims, but the media, which cannot do so, are useless and only protect the perpetrators, and they are nothing more than a blight on society. Isn't it?",10,1
"It would be the leftist press, not the liberal press. Since the lawsuit has been filed, the decision will be left to the judiciary (court). I think the plaintiff restaurant group took a firm stand.　I would like to see the defendants reflect on their actions, but I am outraged by their complete lack of remorse.",1,1
"67 million yen is cheap compared to the damage on the corporate side.　However, the burden on the perpetrator is large.　And in the end, it will be the parents who pay.　I feel a little sorry for them.　I think it would be better to teach these social issues and Internet literacy more strictly in elementary and junior high schools.　(^^;)",1,1
"It will be reduced anyway. If you only have the basis for claiming, you can claim, so you should claim in the hundreds of millions of dollars. I wrote this briefly, but it is very difficult for an individual to calculate the amount of damages in a traffic accident. In Japan, the law only allows the victim to claim up to the actual damages, and the victim is the one who has to prove the damages, so if the victim forgets to include items on the claim form, he or she will cry himself or herself to sleep. Japan is a country that is very hard on victims.",2,2
"Regardless of the amount of money, what the boy did is an unforgivable act. Evil is evil. It is too selfish to ask for forgiveness because he is sorry for what he did. I would like to say that if he is sorry, he should go to jail, but even if that is impossible because this is not a criminal case, if he is to be truly rehabilitated, he should be made to pay compensation, even if it takes the rest of his life. Otherwise, he will not understand the gravity of what he has done, and there will only be more idiots who will imitate him. Also, please stop withholding the boy's real name because he is a minor. This is also detrimental to the understanding of the seriousness of the crime.",5,1
"Well, as an example, he will pay in tens of millions, which will be a useful ruling to prevent in the future. You can make the boy pay for the rest of his life, even in installments. Pay monthly. If you want to help the boy, commentators can help him with the money themselves.",2,1
"Well,...if I think about it in my industry, and I see someone telling me to work on a manufacturing floor because I did something wrong, I just think it's a disservice to those who work in manufacturing. If you cut corners on one dish washing job, sushi will be passed around to customers with dirty dishes. If it comes with detergent, it would be even more of a problem. Ensuring hygiene is no easy task. Even if they are staffed by part-timers, the people there are doing a respectable job for which they are paid, and it is not a place where they are allowed to try out their skills. If it were a sex industry, such a place would be prosperous, but it is not that kind of place.",8,1
"The interpretation is strange because the victim = Sushiro. The victims are ""many employees, part-timers, and related companies whose income has been reduced or will be reduced in the future as a result of this incident,"" and if you add them up, the difference would be two digits. I can't say to the victims who lost their jobs, ""forgive them because they were underage.",3,1
"It's certainly not right. It's rather inexpensive, so it's nothing but warm-heartedness on Sushiro's part. The people who are defending this boy are lucky that Sushiro is a big company this time, but what would they do if a private restaurant did this and customers stopped coming, and the restaurant and its employees lost their jobs? I think they are too naive. Also, I don't think they are that sorry because they are saying that they are sorry but they are refuting the claims. I deserved to be expelled from high school or something. I don't think he will be sorry for doing things like washing dishes, and I think he will repeat the same thing again with just that kind of thing instead of compensation.",1,1
"The Japanese judiciary and the Japanese people's attitude toward crime has been biased since ancient times. In the U.S., where many crimes are committed, sex crimes (especially against minors) are so serious that they are punishable by the death penalty. If the offenders are allowed to get away with such nuisances, they will be treated with contempt and violence (sanctions) by other prisoners if they are incarcerated. If this kind of thing goes unchecked, there will be more and more copycats in the future, and Sushiro's case should serve as a benchmark for the future.""",1,1
"At the time, it was the Corona epidemic. A peroration in that situation would not have been ""just a peroration,"" would it? If he was ""aware at the time,"" he could have imagined that he might die in a severe case. In addition to the claim for damages, considering the circumstances...and taking into account why the measures to prevent corona infection were taken...the boy should be taught the gravity of what he did. It can't be ""just perollution,"" and what he did is very serious.",1,1
"I hope those who are defending this case will hire the person who did this and give him a salary that will allow him to pay back the 67 million. 67 million is a lot of money for one individual, but considering the damage done to the conveyor-belt sushi industry (restaurant industry) by this act, I think it's a small price to pay.",1,2
"If we value equality without discovery like in the U.S. in this case that has nothing to do with us, as you do, do we value a more equal world in other cases as well? It's hard to see how you can call for equality in a case that has nothing to do with you, while calling for fairness in a case that is harmful to you.",2,1
"How Japan's juvenile law is abnormal and is ridiculed as perpetrator first. It is clear that it is out of sync with the rest of the world. The law should be revised, but no one is moving. The president of Sushiro probably wanted to throw a stone at this abomination of the country and the judiciary, though the amount is much smaller. Now let's see what will happen to the people who are so loud about their rights.",3,1
"I was surprised that the amount of damages was lower than I expected. Considering that it is difficult to win the full amount in court or through settlement negotiations, I thought it would be acceptable to claim at least over 100 million dollars in damages. The opinion of a wide-shot commentator who is a former Yakult Swallows baseball player and whose father is a great former professional baseball player known as Mr. Giants is an ignorant, very personal, but angry comment.",2,1
"Well, for me personally, Sushiro's 67 million yen charge is too much! I personally think that Sushiro's 67 million yen charge is too much! Butch, there is a reality that even Sushiro is making money by deceiving customers with fraudulent business practices such as macro falsification and decoy advertisements, and they have settled the matter by apologizing and calling it a day! I think they have been cheating to settle the matter by just apologizing and calling it a day. The fact that the problematic behavior was exposed and sales temporarily dropped is a penalty! But considering the social criticism of the boy, it does not match up proportionally, and the half-price beer issue is now settled by refunding the money! If it is proportional to that, Sushiro should return 1/6th of its 30 years of sales to its customers and apologize to them to ensure the ""proportional equality of pain"". Wouldn't that ensure ""proportional equality of pain""? I think the time has come for companies to bear the same pain as individuals.",1,4
"I am uncomfortable with the opinion that ""other countries would have a different order of magnitude."" This is Japan, a country where the norm is for lost and found items to be returned, and where sexual goodness is the norm. In any other country, not only the culprit but also the fact that the store is not designed in such a way that the staff can always see the customers if they put freely available condiments and food items on the table would be blamed.",2,1
"That is a supremely honest article. I agree. Convenience stores, family restaurants, conveyor-belt sushi restaurants, beef bowl restaurants, and other chain restaurants are often subjected to the same brutality from customers that we take for granted. It is unbearable for those who work there. I would like to see a world where the workers can refuse to accept abusive customers who deviate from the norm.",1,1
"Considering the impact on the restaurant industry, the cost of preventative measures taken by Sushiro at all of its restaurants, the significant drop in sales, and the decline in asset value due to the drop in stock prices, even 670 million yen is a small price to pay. The media defending the perpetrators is nothing short of insane.",58,5
I thought the compensation would be around 1 billion. I think the reason why the amount was set at this level was to adjust the amount to what individuals can afford to pay.,2,1
"I really think so! In fact, I have been visiting Kaitenzushi restaurants less frequently due to this incident, and I am sure that the capital investment for a chain restaurant like Sushiro would have been huge, even if it is only one restaurant. Above all, I wish I could pay for the mental anguish of being so incredibly disappointed by the lack of consideration and low morals of the Japanese people toward the restaurants that always provide us with delicious food at a reasonable price.",1,1
"I don't know about Sushiro, but washing dishes during busy times is really tough. There are piles of dishes to wash that you don't have room to put down. It's certainly not a job that just anyone can do. I think only those who have done the job can understand.",2,1
"The reality is that restaurants are seen as a low status profession among the service industry (by some people), so it is okay to do whatever you want in a restaurant to some extent, and the ""customer is God""...It is true that there are still people with this mindset, but only a small percentage of them. This is the reason why the number of restaurant workers is decreasing.",2,2
"Only advocate personal freedom and forget about duty. The anti-Japanese media that reports only beautiful things, the anti-Japanese opposition party that criticizes the administration for everything, Rikken, Kyosan, Reiwa, etc.️If you break certain manners and rules, you will be severely punished, of course. Just one person's annoying behavior can cause annoyance and discomfort to 99 people. Campsites, cigarette butts, trespassing on the train tracks, riding around on cruisers, trespassing in places off-limits to tourists, eating and drinking while walking, dumping garbage, and distracted driving️Should be severely punished.",2,1
"Everyone has made a mistake or two when they were young...and adults are making a big deal out of it, telling them to go to jail or make amends...it's really not very mature. It's just a kid's prank, after all. No one died. It's just a bunch of people who want to lynch people and say what they want to say. They want to take out their frustration on a boy who can no longer talk back. Can't you think in a progressive way to change your mindset that it was abnormal to have food within easy reach? I've seen children reach for their sushi plates and their mothers put them back in the lane many times in the past, but that's part of kaiten-zushi. If you don't like it, don't go there. Really, it's ridiculous.",3,1
"People who say ""rehabilitation"" are saying that even if their child is attacked or victimized, if the attacker is a minor, ""Hate the crime, don't hate the person. You have a future."" Would you say that? (laugh) If I were in that situation, I would say, ""I'll do whatever it takes to make them pay for their sins. If I were in that situation, I would shout, ""I'll do whatever it takes to make them pay for their sins. So, first of all, he should pay for the damage, and then he can be rehabilitated if he feels the weight of it and reflects on his own actions. It is not reasonable to forgive from the beginning. Has he been punished enough because he was slammed in the media? That's impossible. He's appealing the case while saying, ""I'm living a life of remorse,"" isn't he? (laugh).",1,1
"I hope this is a good example and deterrent, but there is a good chance that something similar could happen in industries other than food and beverage, and they would probably quibble with the ""it's not food"" excuse, which is not an excuse, but simply a responsibility that comes with the action.",1,1
"After all this time, Sushiro was changing a lot of things in the neighborhood, investing in equipment. They must have spent quite a bit of money besides the drop in stock prices. That's pretty cheap for what it is.",1,2
"Maybe it's because you think that I'm an adult and cool for defending the perpetrator's children and their families, and that I'm the cool minority. Well, you can say whatever you want because you were not harmed... If you want to protect them so much, you should pay the 67 million yen or donate your time to fundraising and crafanning. No one will criticize you for it, and it will be a good and inspiring experience for the boy in his human development.",1,1
"I personally think it is a low amount. They should pay compensation for damages, including stock price. I personally think that if you are going to support the perpetrator, you should put your face and name out there and shoulder part of the compensation.",1,1
"This is what happens when an amateur who knows nothing about sushi and has never tried it talks about it. Don't you think that you should ask a sushi restaurant for help only after your parents have disciplined you and you are able to serve sushi to a certain degree? If you leave it to other people or companies from the beginning, you are not fulfilling your responsibility.",1,1
"I don't care how much you charge... you don't get paid much when you charge that kind of money to the general public. Well, I guess they want to make an example... The prank in the video was not good, but more than that, it is very chilling to see the public opinion make the stock price go down because of such a thing, and to see the store's extraordinary response. I was very chilly to see that. That's the level of it.... It's a disgusting world where people are responding to various things in an abnormal and bizarre manner since the development of social networking sites. I don't want to live long in a world where it is difficult to live....",4,1
">""Sushiro"" judges rather than ""punishes"" the judiciary, which is absolutely right, but that's why it's a bad idea to heavily penalize the victims, driven by their emotions (lol). I don't know if you are liberal or anti-liberal, but why don't you discuss this more calmly?",1,9
"If my kid does something stupid and the parents end up paying tens of millions of dollars in real money, I'm going to wonder what I'm working for. At the very least, why not make it a compensation method that can be completed only by the child? I did the dishes as a day job with no experience, and I don't think it's something a professional would do. If you're talking about overseas, you can even be ordered to do community service as a punishment. It would be better to let them learn more instead of letting them quit high school so easily.",1,1
"Is washing dishes or working behind the scenes a punishment? Is the person doing the job being punished? I worked part-time at a sushi restaurant when I was a student and I wasn't doing it because I was being punished in any way! Please stop looking down on people! Your father was a great man, but you are not! Please pray that this comment reaches Kazushige Nagashima.",1,1
"In Japan, even murderers are not punished properly under the guise of ""rehabilitation."" On the other hand, I hear that most of the victims cry themselves to sleep (there are many people who slander the victims), and there is no deterrent except for those who have social status, such as businessmen.",8,1
"I'm not defending the perpetrators, but I wonder if it's really fair that the price of ""licking soy sauce"" is equivalent to killing one person financially. 100 million for a company and 100 million for an individual are too different in weight.",2,1
"Some people are calling for the boy to be rehabilitated and demanding that he be taken into consideration, but although the boy who caused the incident ostensibly apologized, he immediately created another account and posted that he was not sorry and did not think he was sorry.",1,1
"In the U.S., it would be in the news to charge McDonald's because you got fat, or to charge the tobacco company because you got pneumonia, but I think the actual judgment amount is quite low. And in Japan, the amount of direct damage is more common, so it would be about 1,000 yen for the cost of the bottle. Stock prices are usually back in two weeks.",2,1
"The stock price may come back, but trust is not so easy to regain. Compared to the cost of countermeasures and the decrease in sales, I think 67 million yen is a low offer.",1,1
"This is probably the result of the media's incitement of a ""bad prank"" that just happened to be circulated to the public. The media's daily coverage of the issue, which could have been resolved by the owner of the store and his/her parents or guardians, has made it more difficult to get away with it. It is the media who should be rehabilitated for doing what they did and pretending to be the good guys.",2,1
"I don't understand why companies should go out of their way to give juvenile offenders a chance to rehabilitate themselves. If they want to be rehabilitated, they can crawl up by themselves. There are truck drivers who work for former yankees who can serve as role models.",3,1
"It is the same old media opportunism. I believe that the only perspective is how to sell the product and get viewers to see it. Whether it is Sushipero or Jani's sexual assault, I think you should think carefully about whether you would be able to maintain the same attitude if you were the victim.",118,7
"You are absolutely right. And the Japanese compensation is too low, and even if Sushiro wins the whole case, it will probably be about half of what they are asking for (which may be the limit of what this boy can realistically pay in the future). (That may be the limit this boy can realistically afford to pay in the future.) ) Still, it is unforgivable for TV personalities to talk down to the workers.",2,2
"There are quite a few things in the Japanese press that are incomprehensible, such as the habit of showing the victim's face as usual, but hiding the name and face of the perpetrator. The object to be protected is the opposite, isn't it? Frankly speaking, there is no need to be so concerned about the perpetrators, and they should be more than willing to come out for the sake of deterrence in the future.",4,1
"I raised my compensation claim from 67 million yen to 93 million yen. Isn't that too cheap? But isn't it too cheap? If we take into account the large amount of money spent for equipment investment and sanitation management, the decrease in sales due to the tarnished image of conveyor-belt sushi, and the huge loss caused by the drop in stock prices, the compensation would be a whopping 100 million yen, which is a huge amount of money if it were in the U.S.",2,1
"They defend the perpetrators by saying, ""It was just a kid's act, a joke, you don't have to be so hard on him."" This is both the good and the bad thing about the Japanese people. But the times are different. We should not coddle juvenile offenders in order to prevent recidivism. Let's stop the Japanese way of ""naniwa-bushi"". What is bad is bad. We should deal with it severely. Of course, those who spread the news must be punished.",2,1
It is too cheap. But it is also different to see a drop in stock price = essential direct loss. I think the 16 billion figure is too much.,2,1
"It is not because of what other countries are doing, but because it is Japan. The perpetrator has been beaten up by the public, and the private punishment has been completed here. And this time, the assailant is a minor, has repented of his crime, and has dropped out of school. In other words, the public's attack on the perpetrator boy has ended here. From here, it is a matter of individuals and companies. From this point on, the public's view of the boy and the company is almost equal, and there is sympathy for the boy. The school has been expelled, exposed, and beaten to a pulp, and now the public is criticizing the company, saying that it would be pitiful to push him further.",1,2
"The assumption that anyone could prank a customer and that the customer had no malicious intent was bound to break down sooner or later, although that may be true in light of the costs incurred by the restaurant to deal with the series of disturbances.",2,1
"In other countries, ""Minkabu Magazine"" would make companies pay more damages, fines, etc. for unfair acts against workers and consumers, but they never write about such things. As with other articles in Minkabu Magazine, there are many biased and inflammatory articles, so don't trust the articles here.",1,1
"I think that Pero-kun's act cannot be defended considering that he is a high school student and should have known better, and I think that he deserves compensation, but to be honest, I think the timing was also terrible. There have been many cases of bite terrorism that have gone up in flames, and some of them have resulted in the restaurant owner's debt without a proper apology or compensation. I feel that the current situation is the result of an outburst of anger from the public, including myself. I can understand why some people would try to defend him, because I think the anger is directed at Pero Otoko, including the anger that should have been directed at the past perpetrators of byte-terrorism, who are now enjoying their lives. I can't deny that there is an element of making an example out of him, but I hope that this incident will not lead to more people committing stupid acts like this in the future.",2,1
"The former baseball player said ""I did a foolish thing, but I want them to know the hardships of the field and be rehabilitated,"" which may lead to the future of the assailant. It seems like an ordinary family with small children, so if they were to be charged even 1/10th of the amount, it would be the end of this family.",2,1
"First 67 million yen? I thought Sushiro was really mad at me, but 67 million yen? I thought, ""What? I thought, at least there were billions of yen in actual damages and tens of billions of yen in associated damages, so let's just say that writing about anything and everything as if liberals are the enemy is a bit of a newfangled thing.",1,1
"I would like to see more liability charges, make them pay, seizure, and do whatever else they can. There must have been victims who ate the pranked products and dishes. When was the last time you made someone do the dishes at a restaurant to compensate for that? How much would that make up for the huge loss? Those who are talking nicely are outsiders who have not suffered any damage, so they can say such things. If we don't let them make a clean slate here and now, they will commit a crime again if they have such a lickspittle attitude toward the world.",1,1
"This is too cheap! We need to punish them severely! You're absolutely right. If I were in your shoes, I would say, ""Please make it a little cheaper, and divide the amount by the number of stores and ask for one store (T ^ T). No matter how hard I tried, myself as a high school student and my parents and relatives at the time combined couldn't pay 67 million yen.",1,1
"The most important thing that I think should be done is to set a precedent that if you do something like this, you will be awarded not in the millions, but in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.",1,1
"In these cases, the verdict is always 3 million or less, and I've seen private stores even close their doors, but we need to do something about the supremacy of precedents in the courts.",1,1
"In the first place, it would be the judiciary that decides what the punishment should be for this kind of content. The victim solemnly presents the damage done and the amount of compensation he or she wants. The judiciary then decides whether it is appropriate or not. That is all. The people who are mistaken are the self-proclaimed allies of justice who think they can say whatever they want to the perpetrators and the self-proclaimed allies of justice who say that the victims have a life too. It's okay to have an opinion, but the former could be the perpetrator if they are not good enough, and the latter lacks an ally against the victim.",3,2
"I was surprised at the 67 million yen claim because it was a case where I would not have been surprised even if the claim amount was 2 billion yen. Moreover, it is 67 million yen max. The actual amount of the claim is likely to be lower than that. The actual amount of damage may not be that much. However, the amount was probably calculated for various reasons (the purpose is not to drive this boy, similar damage may occur if the claim amount is seen as low, etc.). However, fools come out one after another. After all, ""Do something stupid and you'll die! I think we will have no choice but to file a lawsuit for damages.",1,2
"The liberal media and celebrities defending the perpetrators are simply trying to ""play nice"". They don't think about the social repercussions. In the end, they are all just random, and they don't take responsibility for their words. For example, if new evidence comes to light in the future and the tide turns, they will all turn around and say, ""The compensation is too low! The punishment should be severe! They will say, ""The compensation is too low! It is useless to listen to such frivolous people. The best solution is to quickly introduce a radio auction and put an end to the liberal media, which is a mass of vested interests like that.",1,2
"Considering the impact on the company, I think it's only natural that the perpetrator should be liable for some kind of compensation. But I was concerned that the only ""voices"" in this article are former students or employees of some chain store.",1,1
"It's good, isn't it? I think that the liberal press is actually hindering the rehabilitation of the perpetrators. Either the media is unaware of this, or they are aware of it and are daring to inflame the situation in order to get ratings. Probably the latter. If they really want to rehabilitate the perpetrators, they should just leave them alone. That way, they should be able to live in a more peaceful environment than they are now. The rest is up to the victim and the perpetrator to decide, and if they can't come to an agreement, the court will simply pass a judgment. And as for Sushiro's 67 million yen claim, I don't think they are serious. I don't think the 67 million yen will be approved, and it will most likely end up in a settlement. I think they will probably end up settling the case with a clause in the settlement not to disclose the amount of compensation to the public. However, I don't know when they file a lawsuit next.",3,1
"Cheap. Too cheap. I don't understand the point of defending it. This amount of money is ridiculous just because it is a big company. If it were a private company, it could lead to bankruptcy, family breakup, or worse. If it wasn't that much money, people would think that money can solve this kind of thing.",6,2
"Aside from this assailant boy...this case is an example of how mischievous pranks using the Internet can lead to one's own demise. I think we should collect many such cases and make sure that schools and other institutions teach children from childhood about the risks of posting on the Internet, exposing their faces and real names, and that depending on how they use the Internet, it can lead to their own personal destruction. Of course, education at home is also necessary, but considering the age of the parents' generation, many parents may be less aware of this area, so it is better to start at school. Children are probably taught to carry a crime prevention buzzer and to watch out for cars when walking on the street in order to prevent their children from being exposed to danger, but we should also teach them about the risks of using the Internet. The Internet has become an indispensable tool in our daily lives, and it is difficult to avoid its use. Despite this, too many people do not understand the risks of using the Internet. I think so every time I see a case that has gone up in flames.",2,1
"It is said that the damage caused to Sushiro by this incident is in the hundreds of millions. Sushiro has a large number of employees, and this is a matter of life and death.",1,2
">I would also like to say, from the author's point of view, that it is the judiciary that judges, not ""Sushiro"" ""punishes"", and not Sushiro. This is a misunderstanding of other punishment. Yes, it is true. Sushiro does not punish. And is a claim for damages in a civil suit a punishment? It does not mean, ""I will punish you!"" It's not like ""I'm going to be punished! So please compensate me. The financial burden is certainly tough, but while it may be punishment in effect, it is not punishment, is it?",1,1
"Dishwashing, cleaning, they make you do it because it's difficult. There is no point in having them do easy jobs. It makes sense to have them do such hard behind-the-scenes work. Of course, they must undergo rigorous training and be under a strict supervisor.",1,1
"I think what the kid did should be brought to justice, but Sushiro is also to blame for leaving condiments, seasonings, and even tableware unchanged and failing to ensure safety for the food. The reason for the drop in stock prices and customer traffic is that it was exposed. I think that is what the restaurant industry is most concerned about in this trial. If they say ""other countries would have a different standard,"" then they wouldn't be ""so irresponsible in providing meals in other countries."" And I think Kazushige is a lot better than his father.",1,1
Hmmm. The Internet gives children too much leverage over their mischief to ever be considered. The sad reality is that this is the only way to make children deeply understand this.,1,1
"If business performance goes down due to restaurant terrorism, even employee bonuses will go down. They should file a thorough claim for compensation. Schools and parents should educate their children more about the serious consequences of sending out the wrong message on social networking sites.",2,1
"I always wonder about the term ""liberal"" in these situations. Maybe the media is aware of this, but the outside world is free to take any side they want. The rest is judicial decisions (and if that is the case, the judiciary is too far to the right).",1,2
The future of the guilty must be carved out by the guilty. And it should be understood that excessive assistance can reduce the difficulty of rehabilitation and be a reason for recidivism.,1,1
"The former professional baseball player even said, ""What kind of punishment will Sushiro give the boy?"" Japan does not recognize retaliation, so he has a way of thinking that is quite out of focus with social common sense, including the part of the article that calls for judicial deliberation.",1,1
"The expression ""liberal press"" is incorrect. The literal translation of the word ""liberal"" is ""liberalist. It refers to those who are essentially politically moderate and innovative. Therefore, we cannot call them liberals. They are nothing more than anti-American left-wing agitators. Therefore, their ""righteousness"" is not in line with ""the sense of the general public"" or ""Japan's national interest.",2,1
"If it were in another country, it would be too pointless to point out. It's happening in Japan and the court case is domestic law, so the comparison would be to domestic precedents. There would probably be a cheaper ruling anyway. Still, I think it's pretty damning.",1,1
"I think the root of this kind of evil is Hezumaryu, who called himself an annoying YouTube star.　For a while, he apologized on TV, but then he went on the campaign trail, and now he is in a state of complete exhaustion.　It would not be ridiculous to demand compensation from Hezumaryu, who can be said to have encouraged the nuisance behavior. There is just no way.　Hezumaryu should go on TV more and tell people that what he was doing was absolutely evil. In other words, public execution. If he does it, this will happen, and he will be liable for compensation. Only when he says strongly that his family will be involved, will he apologize for his earlier actions.",2,1
"I think it is a good idea for Mr. Nagashima to refrain from appearing on the TV program because of his comments, just as Mr. Tamagawa refrained from appearing on the TV program. Mr. Nagashima does not seem to think before he speaks, and seems to speak lightly about whatever comes to his mind.",3,1
"I don't get the impression that there are many defensive opinions, but I do think that it's natural that some people have such opinions, while others have harsh opinions, and that's what diversity is all about, and it's good to have a variety of opinions.",3,1
"Isn't 67 million in damages too cheap? In a case like this, is the damage to the restaurant in question, not to Sushiro as a whole? This issue is not just about Sushiro, but the restaurant industry has changed the way it supplies chopsticks, soy sauce, etc., and the costs associated with this change are going to be cried out. I wonder what would happen if other restaurant industries were to file a civil suit for damages for the costs associated with this change. Obviously, there is a causal relationship between the sushi pero...",2,1
"Before you talk about the future of the perpetrators and their future lives, if you think about the future of the victims, their lives, and their company's business, I don't think you can come up with such a small amount of money.",2,1
"A former announcer for a major TV station was also criticized for writing on his social networking site, ""It was just a prank and a prank. She was criticized for not understanding the magnitude of the problem. The fact that the so-called pundits on yesterday's TV program were all over the place in their criticism of the revision of the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act is also symbolic of this mindset. Basically, these liberal media are of the opinion that ""power = absolute evil, people = absolute good. Power = absolute evil, people = absolute good"" and ""Corporations = capitalists = absolute evil, people = workers = absolute good. People = workers = absolute good."" They think that as long as they adhere to the dualism of ""adults are cunning and children are pure,"" they can protect their position as ideological elites who are ""on the side of justice to protect children from the clutches of big business. With the Internet so advanced, I think that stereotype will only reduce circulation and viewership.",4,1
"Damage is damage. There is no reason why the victim should have to suffer, whether the perpetrator is a child or not. If they still criticize, the people who criticize should pay instead. If you ask the media, ""Would you pay instead?"" I wonder what they would say? In short, they are extremely irresponsible.",2,2
"If the viewers look down on the mass media as a garbage, the mass media will become an unprofitable industry and Japan will be closer to normalcy. It is the same thing as the fault of the sovereign Japanese people that politics is bad, and the fault of the mass media is the fault of the Japanese people, the viewers. In a world that is rotten from the ground up, it is hard to do the right thing. It seems that injustice and folly will continue to rule Japan.",1,1
"Even this amount of compensation is just the cost of unnecessary work plus alpha, and it probably does not include the stock price. I don't have to defend them. I don't want to go to a place where I have to show the dishes washed by such a person. It's an important job to begin with. If I wanted to be a minister, I wouldn't have done it in the first place.",1,1
"Well, even in the case of fatal accidents involving murder or reckless driving, some people say ""the perpetrator has human rights"" or in the case of juveniles, ""rehabilitation"" or ""future"". In this case, no lives were involved, and Sushiro had some problems with its consumers. I'm sure there are some. I think that the extent and depth of the inconvenience is ""not even translatable to monetary terms"". There's no room or need to cover for them or care about their future, right? At least not to the general public.",1,2
"In the future, even if he is remorseful now, I don't know if he will be rehabilitated. Once a person does something, he or she will do it again, and repeat it. A lifetime of unforgivable crimes must be shown. I don't care how old he is, I don't care about his family environment, it's the one who commits the crime that's at fault. No matter how much others defend them, it is up to them to make amends.",2,1
"Much like the bullying issue. They worry about the perpetrator's future and do not advocate for the victim's suffering. They push the wrong idea that the victim should be stronger than the perpetrator. If you do wrong, you will be punished. It is a matter of course.",4,2
This is the kind of thing that should be globalized. It's long past the point of being a child.,2,1
"I wonder if you are referring to Kazushige Nagashima? Not only him, but the comment about letting people do backstage work such as washing dishes and carrying things out of the house is missing the point. I think you are confusing this with a good story from the Showa era when people were made to wash dishes for customers who had no money to pay for food and could not afford it. I digress, but I don't think giving compensation will have much of an effect. An ordinary family may or may not be able to pay even 67 million yen, but if it is in the hundreds of millions, it would be even worse. Even ordinary people, let alone the exceptional people who commit ""rice terrorism,"" can't visualize the magnitude of the damage because the amount of money is too large. Those who can visualize the damage would never have done it in the first place.",1,1
"I think it's cheap, 67 million yen. And as this article says, the current judiciary is kind of snooty, protecting the human rights of the perpetrators but leaving the victims to fend for themselves, so something really needs to be done about this.",2,1
"＞There is a world of difference between a stance that values the privacy and ""rehabilitation"" of a peroper boy and holding him accountable for what he has done. Protecting his privacy is a matter of course, and is not controversial. Rehabilitation is only possible after he has taken the responsibility that he should have taken, and at this stage, there should be no lessening or extenuation of responsibility on that basis.",1,2
"If we cover up for the perpetrator or go easy on him, Sushiro's costs will go up, which will be borne by everyone who uses the restaurant without their knowledge. Therefore, I think there should be a claim for compensation.",2,1
"There is nothing worse than an accident, but nothing worse than intentionality. Not only in this case of Sucipero, but also in murder, injury, driving under the influence of alcohol or without a license under the Highway Traffic Law, over speeding, parking violations, etc. There is no mercy for people who do things intentionally.",4,1
"I think so. If you were to do the same thing to a competitor right now, could you do the same thing to them? And would you defend them the same way, the first time, the second time, all together? Even the smallest thing can affect the number of customers. The damages to the store alone would be substantial and immeasurable for the company as a whole.",1,1
"This article led me to search for the difference between ""ozanari"" and ""nazari,"" and I learned the difference between ""ozanari"" and ""nazari,"" which is a very deep Japanese word. The final settlement amount will probably be a few million yen, so there will be a balance between moderate punishment for the perpetrators (the parents) and social significance for the accused.",1,1
"It is not surprising that Japan is different from other countries (where many citizens approve of the death penalty), but it is also possible that companies have neglected the risk by not bringing it to the attention of the public in the first place. The term ""mischief"" or ""nuisance"" should be stopped, and all of them should be treated as ""obstruction of business"".",2,1
"The president of the company defended him, saying that he was a victim, and that's how Sushiro's reputation went up, because he agreed with that. I don't know what he is a victim of, but if he had not said anything unnecessary and had demanded compensation from the beginning, I think the media would not have made a fuss.",1,1
"Frankly speaking, I don't care about Kazushige's comments. Personally, I just think ""Oh, he's just saying stupid things again and getting a kick out of it,"" because he's in the ""stupid TV personality"" category. In the first place, he is a TV personality, not an expert. I thought everyone thought so, so I am rather surprised that it has been picked up so much. The problem is the ""appeals to nice people"" and ""appeals to human rights groups (biased one way or the other, as the article says)"" by people in the ""editorial board,"" ""experts,"" and ""pundits"" categories. There are a certain number of people who believe them. What is unbelievable is that not long ago, the president of Sushiro's parent company made a statement that could be seen as a defense of the sushi terrorism boy, and it was praised. Like Kazushige's comment, it seems that Japanese people are more susceptible to human feelings than to rational (legal) judgment (especially those on the victim's side, who love human feelings).",1,1
"Sushiro is taking measures such as replacing tableware and seasonings at the table with items stored in the store upon customer request. There are 645 stores in the immediate area, so a claim for compensation is warranted even if only for this point.",3,1
"Among Japanese people, there are many people who want to make themselves look good, saying, ""I'm a good person with an open heart and generous spirit. These people are usually the ones who can't read the air and are the ones who float around, but they think they are cool. If I defend this, I have no ability to understand the impact on society in the future.",1,1
"I don't think the actual loss was anything like this. It was clearly a crime of conviction, and there is no room for sympathy. I think it is a natural response to prevent copycats. It is not worth even looking at the comments of former baseball players.",1,1
"In defending the criminal, are you trying to say that ""he has motive, background, and reason for his actions"" or, more to the point, are you intentionally confusing big business and the LDP and saying that ""letting big business and the LDP run wild will lead to a runaway rise of power"" when even you have already turned into ""big business"" and ""power""? Even though they themselves have already become ""big business"" and ""power.",1,2
"I don't see the point of defending it. I'm sorry, so please don't just give me compensation, that's too convenient. If he is truly sorry, he should pay the 67 million. Sushiro may be a big company, but with a loss of 16 billion, the people who will suffer the most are the people working in the stores. It's an outrageous story from their point of view.",2,3
"Is this our national psyche? The logic is that the ""weak"" are ""good"" and the ""strong"" are always ""bad. When a victim is unable to obtain a guarantee from the perpetrator, the tendency is to seek a subrogation-like financial guarantee from the ""government. Even in the case of an unexpected incident, the victim may say, ""If I had done ________ in advance, this incident would not have happened. It is the country's fault for not having taken such precautions, and therefore, the country should pay compensation. If they are minors, it is only natural that their guardians should compensate them with all their money, and if it is not enough, it is only natural that they should take measures to make up for the shortage. If not, the amount of compensation is so reasonable that it can be called ""unparalleled. If it were a company in my group, I would instruct the legal department to add a ""0"" to the amount to be claimed. Such action will deter copycats from following suit and protect our brethren in the small restaurant business.",3,1
"Only when the victim's partner is well compensated in society as claimed by the victim's partner, is that truly rehabilitation, right? Why should the victim have to make a discovery to the offender? That is the job of the defense attorney, isn't it?",3,1
"I know the ""menial labor"" story was from the morning show. I didn't listen to it properly because I was getting ready for work, but wasn't that the ""you won't be able to pay 67 million, so you'll have to labor to make up the difference"" story? I don't think it was nuanced enough to say that the damages would be paid off with menial labor, was I wrong?",1,1
The person who wrote this is right! I feel like I keep hearing about the human rights of the perpetrators in various cases. I feel that the media and lawyers are abnormal. Isn't it justice to be close to the victims? I hope there will be more reporters like the one who wrote this article.,2,3
"The media, the lawyers who immediately come out with anything, and the courts are wrong. In a foreign country, it would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The people who stopped the train (who call themselves ""photographers"") knew what they were doing, so they should show their faces. Where is the need to protect them? Expose them like they did in the past and that will deter them. I'm sure the lawyers who can't afford to eat will be yelling about it soon enough.",9,1
"In Japan, even the parents of the child-rearing generation are no longer educated about moral values, and discipline is conveniently imposed on schoolteachers. In order to avoid their own parental responsibility, the school teachers, knowing that they cannot argue with the bullies, have tried to calm down the bullying, not with the children who were bullied, but rather with the future of the bullies and the school's reputation as a cause for suicide and so on. I think that the parents ""think"" that they have been disciplining the children, but they don't listen to them......・・・・If you don't make the switch, you're not doing the right thing, and you're not doing the right thing for the children...I can't watch the children all day long. I can't watch my children all day long....",1,1
"I think a billion yen is a bit excessive. I thought it was a very compassionate amount of money, but I am surprised that there are people who have any complaints about this.",2,1
"If we are talking about rehabilitating the perpetrators, we should make them take responsibility for what they have done, even more so. I don't think that letting them grow up and be released into society without knowing that their actions come with responsibility will lead to their rehabilitation.",1,1
I think that the idea of being punished for doing the dishes is a bit too much for some people.,2,1
"The Japanese are not good or bad, but their judgment is driven by balance and mother's tears. Some people feel as if big corporations are bullying children. The essence of the social problem goes away.",1,1
"If it is tens of millions, the family and relatives may pay and the person may not feel remorse. If it is in the hundreds of millions, the person will have to work to pay it back. Emotional remorse will be forgotten over time.",1,2
"Sushiro is engaged in dishwashing by the parties involved in the case for the purpose of juvenile rehabilitation. We ask for your understanding. In order to protect your privacy, we will not be able to tell you which restaurant is involved."" It would be a horror story if there was a notice like that.",2,1
"If this was a lawsuit filed by a decent company, I'd say it's not so bad, but it's Sushiro, isn't it? I can't help but think that they are soft on their own scandals and don't take any responsibility for them, but they are very strict with others.",1,1
"Japanese people tend to be rather judgmental. The boy is a minor and in a weak position, while Sushiro is a big company and in a strong position. This may be the reason why they are inclined to protect the perpetrator, the boy. Well, if you can think calmly, you are not affected by such things. There are a lot of people in the world who are not. Like a certain TV personality who is a former baseball player.",1,1
"In fact, this compensation claim is not against the perpetrator himself, but against the person responsible for his/her protection, so the media should emphasize this point. That would serve as a wake-up call for discipline at home, etc.",1,1
"Is it the liberal press? Is it? The ""up to the netizens"" thing was another one of those sentences that sounds like it, but doesn't quite grab me. I understand that the people who were harmed by the incident are not happy, but I think that the uninvolved third parties are getting too emotionally involved with the victimized side. It is the right of a company to claim damages, so they should exercise it, but if the people around them don't help the victims to rehabilitate themselves, the number of outlaws will only increase. If there are more outlaws who don't fear punishment, there will be more crimes. I think it's not so much for the sake of this perpetrator's human rights, but for the sake of society. If we are going to take issue with the lack of imagination of what would happen if a video like this were posted on social media, we should also be able to imagine what would happen if the boy were forced to quit school and incur huge debts.",1,1

"I was at a bar and three drunk guys were sitting at the table next to me. They were playing around with a large amount of table spices (soy sauce, vinegar, and a dash of spice) mixed into their drinks. I went there with the intention of buying oden, but I didn't order oden with a lot of spit on it. I am sure that those who are throwing brave words here should also think about how their casual ""shallow fun"" might come back to them, even if they are the perpetrators. I think...",1,1
"Deterrence is necessary. In that regard alone, the amount is fair. What is important is the fact that a moment's misplaced pleasure will result in a claim for compensation. Trust that you will be equally billed in the future.",1,1
"I can't believe how many people are defending it. If you think about the people on Sushiro's side, do they have time to think about such things? I wonder if Japanese people are swayed by the perpetrators of any incident. I can't forgive even the smallest perpetrator because of the bullying I suffered as a child. I wonder if it is like that for people who have never been in the victim's shoes.",2,2
"In addition to customer trust issues and declining sales, Sushiro has suffered a total loss of 16 billion yen due to falling stock prices and other factors. It would not be surprising if Sushiro were to be charged a sum in the hundreds of millions of yen.",2,1
"I was surprised when I read the comments. ＞＞Sushiro should give this boy a part-time job washing dishes and give him a chance to reflect on his actions. I was surprised to read the comment that ""Sushiro should give this boy a chance to reflect on what he did. If you were a manager, would you want to hire or work with someone who has done so much damage to your company? I wonder why you can't think of something as simple as 'if you were in the same position'.",2,1
"If there are 3 people with 67 million, it is a little over 20 million per person, which I think is an amount that cannot be paid if there are 40 years. If the family pays for it because the person in question is a minor, that's no problem either. If you have that kind of education at home, you just don't do it. Don't lick the plate, don't sit at the table, don't hit the plate with chopsticks, and so on. And so on.",5,1
"Not only Sushiro, but all companies in the restaurant industry should stop advertising in the left-wing press. This will weed out irresponsible self-proclaimed liberals. The effectiveness of advertising in the broadcasting industry, such as TV, has been declining for some time now, so it should all be directed to the communications industry, such as social networking.",1,1
"The story of ""Ako Ronin,"" which is still loved by Japanese people, is a story in which a person related to the assailant took the life of a victim of a murder-suicide, motivated by the dissatisfaction of the assailant who was forced to commit seppuku, without knowing the truth or mystery of how the assailant was killed in the first incident. The story is still praised to this day, as the public opinion at the time praised the story and the regime refused to forgive the perpetrators, and the perpetrators offered to commit seppuku themselves and ended up committing seppuku. The Ako Ronin also seem to have been disgruntled by the fact that only the victim side was acquitted, contrary to the ""kenka ryo sei defeat"" principle, and the Japanese DNA seems to have a conflicted relationship with the relationship between the offender and the victim, with the equality of the parties like ""kenka ryo sei defeat"" and the humanistic bias like ""naniwa bushi"" added to it.",52,212
"The former baseball player in question is a conservative. Not all media are liberal. In fact, the Yomiuri Group is conservative. The Fuji Sankei Group is conservative. The Nikkei Newspaper Group is conservative. Kodansha is conservative. Shogakukan is conservative. Shinchosha is conservative. There are many more. When did the media become so liberal? Well, it is conservatism that cannot keep up with the changing times.",1,1
"Sushiro apparently has 645 stores. The incident only happened at one store, but there would have been damage at all stores. Including the cost of future countermeasures, 64.5 million seems reasonable at 100,000 per store.",2,2
"It really is. The future of the perpetrators. Such a tendency is also the reason why people are too lenient to change their attitude unless someone becomes a human pillar. And those who try to pretend that they are good people cannot think from the victim's side because they are not the victim themselves. They have no imagination. They can say that it is too much because they are not the one who pays for it. In other words, what is manageable in Japan today is not manageable at all. The more we do these things, the less people will cry.",6,1
"Of course, it is only natural that he should be held liable for this amount of damages, but shouldn't Takizawa Galeso and others who made this so much fun and spread it around so carelessly and caused so much damage be held liable for even greater damages?",2,1
"Rehabilitation? There is no such thing as rehabilitation. I think 67 million yen, or even 670 million yen, would be good, but he won't be able to pay it anyway.",2,2
"I have the impression from what I've seen on social media that many of the people defending the child are left-leaning for some reason, and I think it's too selfish to criticize the company's response when you weren't the one who was harmed in the first place.",1,1
I thought the position of the victim company and the employees/investors were very different! Was it assumed against risk management? Was the sense of the times due to the sexual goodness of the company unexpected? Isn't there a responsibility/sharing ---?,2,1

"The actual compensation is less than a million, right? Then the perpetrator will be spending millions in legal fees, which is an expensive learning curve. I feel that if they knew how much it would cost, there would be no more nuisances.",1,1
"I mean...I think it's strange that consumers are making the decision not to eat sushi because of the tongue-twisting. All they have to do is to bring a new soy sauce bottle, right? That kind of thing... I think the excessive sanitarianism that judges what is edible to be inedible is abnormal.",1,3
"Well, the damage is immeasurable.... Because I am actually the same way. Since then, my family and I have been eating at Sushiro, but we changed to another restaurant. The place we switched to is so good that I don't think we will go to Sushiro any more.",3,2
"The article says, ""Other countries might have one or two different digits."" I'd like to know what the actual response is to these cases overseas. I would like to know how such cases are actually handled in other countries. I would like to know the facts.",1,1
"I have no comment on how much Mr. Perot is charged, as it is a matter of civil lawsuits by both parties, but I wonder about the state of society in which no one complains about the injustice of politicians or corporate executives, but when the perpetrator is an individual, society as a whole takes so much pains.",13,32

"The current conveyor-belt sushi system is not adapted to the z-generation.... The only way is for companies to change their business model. This is true not only for the restaurant industry, but also for services and manufacturers. People have changed.",2,2
"Since the liberals' goal is to bring in the Red Army and the People's Liberation Army, they want to dismantle the Self-Defense Forces, neutralize the police, and create chaos in the country, it is only natural that they would want to exacerbate the perpetrators and discard the victims.",1,1
"The perpetrator is no more or less than the perpetrator and does not need to be defended at all. If a terrible crime is committed and the victim dies, people will come to the defense of the perpetrator. They say there is room for rehabilitation, they are remorseful, and if they are not rehabilitated, they want them to take responsibility. Most perpetrators will say they are remorseful because there is a possibility of a reduced sentence if they say they are remorseful. My father-in-law, a hitter, also says he is sorry every day, but that doesn't mean the world will move a millimeter. On the other hand, if you say you are not sorry at all, you will only be beaten. I wish the world would be like that if we don't take responsibility for what we do.",3,1
"You can do whatever you want because you are a child. It doesn't mean ""It's a child, so you can do whatever you want. It is just the result of the parents' failure to teach the children what is good and what is bad on a regular basis.

"No... since the boy's side has claimed significance for this damage... and has already expressed remorse and apologized... maybe in a foreign country, it would never be forgiven. They don't feel the weight of what they have done to destroy the unique Japanese system. They are responsible for destroying all the common sense of the Japanese people.",2,1
"It may be none of my business, but is the photographer not to blame? Isn't the photographer sort of encouraging criminal behavior, just as the passenger is guilty of drunk driving?",4,1
"The media has a strange policy. They are absolutely critical of the stance of the companies that have been harmed and offer suggestions to help the perpetrators, but when the government screws up, they are overwhelmingly treated as criminals and are dismissed without offering any suggestions. Here, we focus all our efforts on helping the victims. Shouldn't the press be as flat as the judiciary? If the plaintiffs do not win this lawsuit, even if they win part of the case, how will the press cover it? Knowing how little discovery is involved in similar lawsuits in the U.S., it seems ridiculous to me that things are happening in Japan.",1,1
"The media system, which delves into the perpetrators' lives and defends them, is too cheap compared to the amount of loss, but if they charge too much, it may affect the bonuses of all employees, although they have not gone out of business because of the media's coverage that tarnishes the corporate image of large corporations. This is a typical example of how the media's favoritism toward judges is not good when it goes too far.",1,2
"I felt that Kazushige Nagashima, who grew up in a humble family and did not know much about society, was making such a big suggestion. Anyway, Sushiro's offer was too low. Many people may have refrained from going there after that one incident (in fact, I did). Recently, I feel that restaurants that provide customers with condiments such as sauces and chopsticks on a self-service basis are disappearing. The restaurant in the food court I visited yesterday always had sauces and other condiments outside the restaurant, but now the staff manages them and gives them to customers when they say they need them. This has a direct impact on sales, so it must have a significant impact on other companies.",1,1
"Not only did the stock price plummet, but many people must have avoided going to Sushiro for a while because of the filthy atmosphere. I think the amount of the bill is a warm-hearted one. If they work hard, they can pay it back!",2,1

"Sushiro was ordered by the Consumer Affairs Agency to take action against Sushiro for deceiving customers with false ""bait and switch"" advertisements... In short, they are too soft on themselves and too hard on others. I wouldn't want to go to a restaurant run by a company like that.",2,1
"What is it with people who look at backstage, menial jobs, front line, field work, hard work, and so on in a petty and ridiculous way? Nagashima, for example, is aware that he is active in a bright spot. And the rest of us are behind the scenes. Who do they think they are? They seem to have no bad intentions, but deep down they are taking advantage of the situation.",1,2
"When I heard that it was 67 million yen, I thought that Mr. Sushiro was very reserved. It was clear that if he demanded billions of yen, he would be overstepped, so I wondered if he had set the amount he could pay over his lifetime.",1,1
"For some reason, everyone continues to demand good manners from social networking users, despite the fact that it is a flawed system that drives juveniles to do bad things and takes a huge hit to stock prices. Don't let the Internet become real.",2,1

"I think Sushiro paid out a conscientious amount for the damages, which is conscientious considering that it is normal for them not to charge 100% full amount. I heard a commentator on a TV program, Mr. Ojakama, said something about this, but he does not have the public's sense, so he is not even helpful.",1,1
"I would like to know the basis for setting this amount. Is it the result of an investigation of the assailant's assets? Either way, the perpetrator's request to drop the charges is hardly a remorseful situation. It is extremely distasteful.",1,1
"What is it saying about the media that has taken the initiative in publicizing the incident... If it had only been an ""internet fire"", it might not have been so serious and would have had less impact on the perpetrator's reintegration into society.",2,1
"You are absolutely right. If Sushiro breaks here, there will be more crimes of this type in the future, so I hope they will proceed quietly. Just like calling theft shoplifting to give it a lighter image, this is no longer a prank. You can say you are sorry for a traffic ticket and get an exemption! That kind of thing.",5,1
"If you're going to cover for them, why not make it up to them, even if it's 10 million yen or 1 million yen? Let's show it by our actions. I think 67 million yen is low, but I think it is a reasonable amount that can be paid without renunciation.",2,1
"If Kazushige were to encounter a robbery or a soy sauce perverted nuisance at a restaurant he runs, I would want the police to thoroughly investigate this person's background, family environment, and backstory to ask if this robbery was an organized crime and why it led to such a nuisance. I would say. I would never say the same thing to the criminal (boy) about washing dishes. The TV, the netizens, the robbers, the nuisances, in the end, they are all someone else's problem, so they can say whatever they want, and if I were a victim, I would be outraged.",19,1
"I totally agree. I don't understand how anyone can say something so lenient to the perpetrator; even a TV station would be annoyed and offended if an outside party did something socially illegal during a live broadcast, wouldn't they? I think it is the same thing. Once a crime has been committed, it doesn't matter at all if you are usually a good boy or girl. What you did is all that matters, and it is only natural that you will be judged in a judicial forum. At the same time, you are right that there is no ""need for the victim to be involved in the rehabilitation of the offender"". I am sick and tired of the amateur commentators on the wide variety of TV shows.",3,1
"That's a lot of money for a girl with such a low standard of living to pay back with a normal job. She would have to take home at least 400,000 a month, live with her parents and have no allowance for a long time, and take out a 35-year mortgage with a very low interest rate.",1,2
"I think that is a fairly low amount considering the damage the store has suffered. But the interest rate on the damages seems to be 3%. 67 million yen would be 2.01 million yen in the first year. If you don't have any assets or a house to sell, you'll never be able to pay it back.",4,1
">""Sushiro"" is not ""punishing"" him, and this reporter is no different than a certain former baseball player. This is not ""punishment"". It is simply asking for the money back for damages. It gets complicated when you say damages = punishment. If it were a punishment, it would be called ""obstruction of business"" or a fine. A fine never goes to the victim. Sometimes people lump fines and damages together, but I doubt this reporter is one of them.",12,7
"In the current educational system, many children are unable to judge what is wrong because they do not get angry when they do wrong. This is because there are more and more children who are not smart enough to play these pranks with impunity or who can only appeal to others through pranks.",4,1
"A former professional baseball player may say that he himself had to deal with pressure and hardships from others, but he became a professional baseball player for whatever reason, continued to be a professional baseball player for whatever reason, became a commentator after retirement, and is now a TV personality and commentator, so does he really understand the hardships behind the scenes? Do you really understand the hardships behind the scenes?",3,1
"At any rate, it's still lighter than eating and running away. I should have imagined that there would be more than an order of magnitude of compensation awaiting me since it is a criminal act involving social credibility.",2,1
"Washing dishes, bringing in the stuff, cleaning up. Who is going to guide and supervise that? You can't leave someone alone who doesn't know the difference between what is right and wrong, can you? Someone has to monitor them, right? Who is going to do that?",2,1
"It is common knowledge that ""in other countries, the difference would be orders of magnitude greater. For example, I have heard that the compensation for ""cheating"" is 300 times higher than the fare in Switzerland. It is necessary to teach global common sense to the perpetrators and those who defend them.",14,1
This is a very biased article. I can't believe that the media is defending the perpetrators. Why can't we think that these incidents are not only individual problems but also a problem of social structure?,3,1
"Why do so many in the media support the perpetrator who did such a stupid thing, when it is perfectly natural for the perpetrator to be ready and willing to do what he did. If it is good to forgive everything like some saint, will these media people forgive the perpetrator even if someone takes or loses something in the course of doing business? If they are not prepared to do so, I personally think that their misguided support for the perpetrator will only make the article less credible and reliable. If you want to go that far to support the assailant, why don't you just shoulder the 67 million yen in damages?",2,1
"You are absolutely right! Why should the victim rehabilitate the perpetrator? You're free to express your opinion. Because the victim is a minor? Sushiro originally said he would act in accordance with the law when this case first came to light. And the compensation is 67 million yen, right? There is nothing wrong with that. Wouldn't it be better to keep quiet except for the perpetrators and victims who are the parties involved? Then, after the results of the trial, they can complain to the court or whatever. Complaining to Sushiro is not right... What happened to the restaurant industry in the first place, thanks to this Peropero-kun? What happened to the restaurant industry? They had to stop putting seasonings on the counter and take other measures, right? I also started to ask for condiments, wondering why it was such a hassle... I remember the phrase, ""Even a monkey can do it if he's only sorry""? I remembered the phrase, ""Even a monkey can do it if he's only sorry. How do you act after you are sorry? I have no sympathy for the perpetrators who remain remorseful.",1,1
"I don't understand why you're defending him, child or not, I want him to be punished well, and I don't know how much he can actually get, but I want him to be able to get as much as he can without settling. The lawyer said in another article that bankruptcy won't help, and I want him to spend the rest of his life paying for it.",12,1
"If all stores nationwide were to take action, the total cost of countermeasures + loss of customers due to image damage = 67 million yen, which I think is a much lower amount.",1,1
"I think the boy is one-sidedly wrong about this matter, but I was disappointed to hear that he refutes this claim, saying that the decrease in customers could be due to competition from other stores in the same industry. Is he really sorry for what he did?",1,1
"The argument in this article is that it is liberal to defend the perpetrator, but that is false liberalism. It is natural for people to be condemned and punished for illegal and disruptive behavior, regardless of their ideology. It is satanic thinking to say that this is wrong.",1,1
"I think there is a mistake between failures that can be defended and failures that should not be defended. I think there is a contradiction in that Japan does not tolerate failure in the face of daring challenges, yet it defends actions that are only malicious in intent.",1,2
"The nurturing by adults who do not understand the gravity of the situation, such as ""it only takes one blow to the ribs,"" are people who do not understand the power of social networking and the Internet, who do not understand that one post on a social networking site can destroy a company or take a life. They are people who lack the imagination to think about how their words will affect the people around them when they post on the Internet. They are on the same level as the people who do this kind of annoying things who can't imagine what will happen if they do this.",2,1
"In fact, this is the amount of money they would have paid if they had made the maximum concession. Compared to the total amount of damage, 67 million is not too much. I wonder how good-natured they are. It is not only the company that was damaged by this boy. It is not only the company that has been damaged by this boy, but also everyone who works for the company, everyone who is involved with the company, and even their family members.",1,1
It is nonsense to think of it simply in terms of high and low. There are more cases where people who cannot pay end up not paying even if you ask for a large amount of compensation. The amount of money will be determined by the competition between the two.,3,1
"There are many in the liberal press who are not only dissatisfied with the existing Japanese social system, but also plot to legitimately overturn it. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, and this boy who is causing social unrest is like an action warrior for them. That's why they defend him.",1,1
"It is impossible to call Kazushige Nagashima's opinion a liberal media...lol...because he has nothing liberal, conservative, or leftist about him. The overwhelming opinion on the internet is ""Sushiro, good job! Right. Well, civil suits are often settlements, not verdicts, so it will be about 1/10th of the amount, but it will serve as a warning to the foolish youth.",2,2
"Nagashima is a ""liberal""?　You seem to have a great misunderstanding. In Japan today, a liberal is a conservative who values discipline and tradition, and the defense of the Constitution is a typical example of this. As we can see from the ""miner card"", it is the money-worshiping LDP and Ishin who want to change the status quo to suit their own needs.",1,4
"If you are forced to wash dishes, you might spit on them to make them angry. Even if they don't, I think the customers do. Kazushige is a young boy, so he thinks too much of good intentions.",2,1

"If you want to defend him, why don't you collect 67 million yen and do it? Instead of blaming Sushiro, wouldn't it be better for him to understand that Aronna worked for him in that way?",1,2
I'm wondering if the stance that punishment for crime should be fair and that we should cooperate with rehabilitation after the crime is atoned for is a strange one because it mixes up normal flow punishment and rehabilitation.,1,1
"Self-proclaimed liberals think that the perpetrators should be given mercy and rehabilitation, but the general public's main concern is whether the victims will be rehabilitated. This is where liberals are out of touch with the general public.",3,1
"This affected our sales and forced us to change our business operations, and I believe we had to make changes to our manuals in a hurry.",2,1
"Do you know what liberal means? You are trying to destroy the opportunity to disprove, or at least the idea of disproving, the left's absurdity by calling them ""liberal"". The media, which only shouts condemnation of the perpetrators but never examines the causes of the crime, is also out of order. It's time for the Japanese people to reflect on the fact that the ruling party has become this big while they are taking pleasure in looking down on the left opposition party.",3,1
"Since the stock price has dropped by 16 billion yen, even if only temporarily, it is a fact that the company has caused great inconvenience to many people. It would be cheap if the compensation claim was only 67 million yen.",3,2
"If we don't impose a significant amount of compensation as an example, we will get a second and third pero. It sounds like they are asking for the damages to be dismissed, but if they allow that to happen, there will be a second and third pero pero pero. Besides, some commentator said it's about 30 million, which is pretty cheap. If it were really overseas, it would be an order of magnitude, maybe two orders of magnitude more.",2,1
"To those who defend the perpetrator, you can say, ""Okay, I'll lower the bill to the perpetrator. You pay the difference instead. If they are truly defending the perpetrator, they will pay that lightly.",6,2

"There are good and bad things to do, even if you are Jordan or mischievous. It is still better to take a firm stand against behavior that makes others uncomfortable...",3,1
"That's too cheap! There are just over 600 stores in Japan, so the cost of remodeling measures would be 110,000 yen per store, right? There is no way they can do the work for that kind of money...it would cost at least 200,000-300,000 yen per store, so if we calculate that, the construction cost for the stores alone would be 100-190 million yen, plus over 200 million if we include system changes and actual damages. I think it's a very reasonable bill. ・・・・ If they charge this amount, the perpetrator's family will have no choice but to file for bankruptcy... I think it would be a good thing if these annoying youtubers would desist from their extreme behavior in order to get more views! I think the media companies should also have an AI system to monitor and prevent these extreme postings, and I think the media companies are responsible for this...",1,1
"I used to use Sushiro, but I stopped going to Sushiro after the advent of the sushi pero boy, and I can say that I have lost more than 10,000 yen in the last 6 months alone, 67 million yen, which I can pay off, so I want to give up my house, car and marriage, and live my life properly just to compensate for it.",1,2
"You are absolutely right, people who use social networking sites should know that their postings are not just pranks, regardless of age. Parents should take this opportunity to educate their children.",4,1

"I think Sushi Pero is damaging not only Sushiro but the whole ""conveyor-belt sushi"" industry. 67 million yen is the amount of the claim including warm-heartedness, but what is the Sushi Pero family thinking to ask for dismissal of it?",5,1

"This is the article about this lawsuit that was closest in thought and gut-wrenching. This expression, ""reporter"", makes me feel like a ""reporter"". >>The damages of 67 million yen is not likely to be the full amount. Still, it is a large amount in a country where such acts have been dismissed as ""mischief"".",1,1
"The Japanese media, when a disturbance occurs, digs up a ton of nonsense and makes a big deal out of it, but when time passes and emotions settle down, they turn around and say, ""You're right, I'm right!

"You're not defending him, you're balancing him. There is no point in beating the boy in line with the rest of the world anymore. Legal action has been taken. Lately, there are more and more people who make a fuss about ""misinformation"" and ""bias"" whenever there is even a slight difference between what they think and what the public thinks.",3,1
"Well, you are right, but in the end, it seems like a loop of, 1) those who criticize the offender, 2) those who criticize 1) and take pleasure in defending the offender, 3) those who take pleasure in beating 2), and honestly, I don't care. This article seems to have been written by person (3). What I also find a little offensive is the label ""liberal media. I don't know what that means, but is Kazushige Nagashima a representative of the liberal press? It seems to me that he seems to be leading them to his own ideology. I guess he thinks that if he says the LDP is bad and the opposition parties are bad, it makes me TUEEE, but 、、、、 is shallow. If you want to say that other countries are bad, why don't you show us similar examples of other countries?",1,3
The media is probably bound by the value that it should be the voice of the weak. It's all about the individual vs. big business. The media should also have a mission of social justice.,4,1
"The media always talk about young people who have a future, but the truth is that they are young people who have stolen the future (of the victims). I always wonder why TV stations are so protective of the young perpetrators. I think there are more and more news reports that do that these days. It seems that there are more and more news reports that think so these days. Don't TV stations have their own opinions?",1,1
"Isn't it best to do away with such liberal media? For example, they will not run any commercials on Teresa or TBS from now on. Newspapers are already wackos, so they probably don't advertise in the first place, so they won't give interviews to the Asahi or Mainichi newspapers, for example.",3,1
"I don't think it's so much about other countries, but rather that Japan is too lenient. I remember a court decision a few years ago in the U.S. that ordered a 15-year-old boy to pay 4 billion Japanese yen for a wildfire caused by a firework he intentionally threw.",1,1
It appears that the company that is doing the disguising and hype has offered an unscrupulous amount of compensation in order to change the perspective of the scandal. I don't think it has anything to do with the workers or anything else.,3,4

"But this is not to drive the offender to the corner of society, nor to drive him or her to the corner of society, but to make everyone recognize that the crime is the crime and the responsibility is the responsibility for the sake of social order, and to make the offender reflect and rehabilitate himself or herself.

"It's a trash tradition. Since the Showa era, they have been shouting loudly about the ""human rights of the perpetrators. Lawyers and bar associations were just to protect ""weak defendants"" from state power, and prosecutors were ""ogres"" who wielded state power, and the atmosphere was that ""it is right to protect weak defendants from strong prosecutors. And, ""Ignore the victims. Leave the victims behind. It is the victim's fault. Around the middle of the Heisei era, the first TV drama ""HERO"" was created in which a prosecutor was the main character.

The main character said to the prosecutor in the second episode, ""Only a prosecutor can take the victim's side, right? A dead victim can't testify in a trial.

I doubt if they can even pay that...",1,1
"I don't think the perpetrators are being defended. Every media outlet is all over the place and making an issue out of it, so what more can you do? On the contrary, I want to ask. I hope they are judged harshly under the law because they have done the worst.",2,2

By the way, I agree with most of what the article says, but I really don't get how Kuminkabu Magazine can be ""in the liberal media"" just because of this incident. It's totally right-wing/conservative media. They should have just talked about stocks.... Frankly, this change is weird, even though I'm used to this media after investing.",2,1

"This has killed the culture of conveyor-belt sushi, which is also a form of entertainment, and now the lanes are spinning but the sushi is not, and that's an unforgivable existence for the industry.",1,1
"You are right. I was afraid that the family would end up in a family feud, or that domestic violence would increase, and I felt sorry for my brothers and sisters, but eventually they would even get welfare, and a sin is a sin, right?",1,1
"If the media and the judiciary defend the perpetrators with lenient punishments, those who commit crimes will only have the information and knowledge of such punishments, so they will anticipate and do it again! These criminals will never go away!",1,1
Nagashima is not a liberal. There are many comedians and commentators who think they are patriots and argue that they should be forgiven for punching one and this reporter is trying to lead public opinion with falsehoods because he wants to hit liberals.,2,1
I think it's just this one thing that makes people criticize. They should sue anyone who did the same thing. The fact that they don't do that and just go along with it is the soil for defending the perpetrator.,1,1
"It's not that they want money, it's that they want this kind of behavior to go away, and if they want one individual who is currently a student to actually pay for it, it's a well-thought-out amount of money.",1,1
">67 million, regardless of the pros and cons, it still might be one or two orders of magnitude different in other countries. Exactly. In the U.S., people who got burned for the act of licking ice cream and putting it back on the shelf were fined hundreds of thousands of yen.",1,2
"In other countries where hygiene is rare, I'd think they're innocent. Indians eat with their hands. Japan is hysterically clean. If there's a little bug in the food, they turn everything around. Too hysterical. And yet they don't care about car exhaust.",1,1
"The restaurant terrorist attacks were motivated by the person who wanted to post them on social media, so inevitably the perpetrators were identified and paid the price, and as a result, the situation went downhill. Now we have to do something about the photographers.",1,1
"If you do something wrong, you deserve to be punished accordingly. Age is irrelevant. Rehabilitation is a completely different issue. I don't understand why there are people who defend it.",1,1
This is a good opportunity to review the lightness of crime in Japan. The sentences should be stricter to reduce the number of crimes.,9,1
"In civil compensation cases, if the perpetrator is a high school student or older, he is responsible for his own expenses, not his parents. 67 million yen is an amount that even a salaried worker can pay back. Please repay the money while chewing on your own stupidity.",2,1
"If you aim for the top of any job, it becomes a job that a fake amateur can't do very well. It is only a lack of insight to respect a certain job and despise a job you don't know.",1,1
"Japan is lagging behind the rest of the world in every respect. This is because hard-headed old men called ""conservatives"" are still standing on top, preventing young buds from growing up. I think that the laws and ideas that the ""conservatives"" have been defending should be updated to the laws and ideas of the current era.",60,202
"The original idea of the perpetrator is to think about how to pay, not whether or not he can pay. It is unimportant from the victim's point of view whether he/she is remorseful or rehabilitated.",2,2
"I've summarized this as a liberal's fault, is that right? I think that some of the famous Nisei TV personalities who often appear on the show have made defensive statements. Here is what they had to say",1,1
"Even 67 million yen in damages is cheap. Japan has become a country where similar shenanigans will not stop unless it shows a willingness to pursue responsibility to this extent. It is lamentable, but it can't be helped.",1,1
We hope that the judiciary will issue a firm ruling in case such cases arise in the future.,1,1
"Sushiro, you do a lot of things like false advertising and false fish. Did they pay compensation for that? They are still in business because they are allowed to do so by the people around them.",2,2
"In reality, this boy (rather old-fashioned name) will have difficulty finding a job outside of Sushiro in the future. Financially, he will probably end up bankrupt, jobless, and on welfare.",1,1
I think it would be better to use a mosaic that would benefit the victims of these types of reputational incidents and accidents.,1,1
"The reason why they are asking for so much money for damages is to make them realize the seriousness of the situation, but if they think they will be forgiven after washing the dishes, what good will it do? You will never be rehabilitated! I'm washing dishes! I'm washing dishes!",1,1
"Regardless of whether it is admissible in court, it would not be out of place if it were an order of magnitude or even two orders of magnitude larger, considering the market capitalization lost and so on.",1,2
"Someone who seemed to be a member of a certain political party came to negotiate the withdrawal of the damage report. Why a certain political party? Someone who frequents that office, a member of the party? Especially when the other party is a minor, they are very noisy about the future, rehabilitation, and general secretary.",1,1
"The perpetrator is protected in both murder and car accidents. It's not right! Even in compensation, if you have no assets, you can't get it, and you cry yourself to sleep. It's ridiculous, isn't it? Why don't they monitor them for the rest of their lives and make them pay if they have income?",1,1
"I'm not defending Sushiro, but considering the scandals that preceded it, I have no sympathy for Sushiro, and I didn't feel comfortable with the YouTube videos of all the youtubers going out to eat. I don't want to defend Sushiro,",1,2
"It's often the case in this country that the victims are left behind - because they are juveniles - or that they are encouraged to rehabilitate themselves. I hate that there are so many bad commentators and experts who want to be thought of as people who understand. Before rehabilitation, it is compensation. Those who filmed it and those who spread it are equally guilty.",4,1
"The man in the photo must be thinking, ""I don't get it..."" to be used in an article like this. Why would he assume that he would be further reduced from this amount, when the damage is not even close to 67 million yen? It's so annoying. It's not that small a sum.",2,1
They may have thought that a higher amount would not be paid and would damage the company's image. This exquisite amount of money might be too damaging for the perpetrator.,1,1
"I have to admit, I did a punishment game once upon a time where I had to eat all the red ginger at Yoshinoya's. Now I think about it, it was annoying, not a crime, but it was a prank that went too far.",2,1
"＞What did (the restaurant) do? It's strange."" Someone who remembers the false advertising incident that occurred before the video was circulated is probably replacing the store with Sushiro as a whole and bringing in the either-or argument. This is still a defense of the boy, depending on how you look at it.",1,2
"What a beautiful and sweet thing to say. I would worship your face if someone said the same thing to me if I were a property damage or disability victim, including of course my family.",2,1
"No media outlet is protecting the perpetrator's actions. They just claim that just because they are the perpetrator, it doesn't mean that they are allowed to invade your privacy.",3,1
"The parents of the perpetrators in question... Politicians? The president of a major corporation? I guess so. Japanese people like to be under a big tree. For example, Ultraman, Kamen Rider, Mito Komon, and so on...don't they instill the idea that ""justice"" is just a figment of the imagination?",1,2
">Dishwashing and cleaning are really important jobs. You can even say it is the most important. There is no more difficult job if you are serious about it as a professional and as a craftsman. >If it is so important, why do all restaurants have newcomers and part-timers do it?",4,1
"They should be firmly condemned. They should be made aware that they are part of society, including schools.　They should be taught that ""just because they are children"" is not acceptable.",2,1
"The judiciary will decide. Well, not only this, but wrong actions are rampant because the crime is too light.",32,1
"It is no different than when a classmate is bullied and chooses to commit suicide. Is the defender ""liberal""? Far from it!",1,2
All they think about is trying to increase the number of searches by writing articles that will shake things up. Minkabu (a media outlet that is littered with radical articles) itself is also self-serving in trying to force the issue to the liberal or right-left.,2,1
"I think the fundamental idea is that the media is always the perpetrator. The media is now ""allowed to do whatever they want"" for the sake of ""freedom of speech. Well. I don't blame my friends.",1,1
"Rehabilitation and responsibility are two different things. You have to take responsibility for your actions this time, whether you are rehabilitated or not.",3,1
"No, it's not! It's because the media beat them up too much. The media was leading the beatings themselves, but since ""the perpetrator has been socially sanctioned"" and ""the perpetrator has shown enough remorse,"" they just started saying, ""I feel sorry for him,"" ""That's enough,"" and ""Let's forgive him.",2,1
"This should definitely be litigated, and there will be no end to the number of people posting this on social media, YouTube, etc. The restaurant industry will collapse. Also, the biggest problem is the commercial fees for these postings.",4,1
"In Europe and the U.S., it would be 10 times or more. Actions that damage a company's image are required to be more than just physical damage. Japan is too lenient.",2,1
"Even if a judgment for large damages is confirmed, if they decide to ignore it completely like Hiroyuki did, there is nothing to take from a student who is not an employee of the company.",1,1
"I've had boys beat up on me, and the lawyers on the other side would say things like, ""The boy's future is at stake,"" and I'd want to say, ""Don't you think about what you've done?",1,1
"You say rehabilitation... there have been annoying videos for several years now, and I don't really have the impression that the perpetrators then and now have become more reasonable. Hezuma Ryu, for example. The guy who tsuntsun oden at the convenience store is also on YouTube under a joke name.",4,1
"In the U.S., I spilled coffee on myself and burned myself, then went to court against McDonald's claiming that the coffee was too hot and won $3 million in damages.",1,1
"There are some people who are saying that they want me to wash dishes, but there is no way that people who are far from the funny level can do anything right.",2,1
"Why don't you just say ""Nagashima""? Laughing, he makes a comment that hits the mark about once every 10 times, but the rest of the time he is just plain wrong, and this time he was the one who was wrong. This is because he disrespects the backstage staff. If you want to work at Sushiro, you should have an interview first. Of course. LOL.",3,1
"I think we need an example of this kind of high billing to let the world know. However, when I think about it calmly, I feel that there are more examples. I see what you mean when I look at the source. LOL.",3,1
"So what are the rulings in similar cases in other countries? I haven't seen any specific case law presented in the news or comments that say ""in Japan"" in Japan.",1,1
"It has been a long time since the subject of morality was introduced, but what is being taught in the field of education? Too many young people have no sense of ethics and morality.",1,1
It can't be helped that Japan is a precedent-oriented country. The only way is to accumulate precedents that gradually raise the amount of compensation. The media is at such a desperate level that the only way is for the public to nurture the emerging generation because they know they can no longer change.,35,4
"As you say. Too little. Can't afford to pay?　The family's property holdings (real estate, deposits, etc.) should be thoroughly investigated and they should be made to pay back the loan decisively.",2,1
A large sum of compensation that most ordinary people cannot afford to pay. I don't want us to become a horrible society that makes people throw away their lives for the slightest mischief they can think of.,1,2
">""Still, there are people who are defending Peropero boy. I think it's terrible."" Since it's only 67 million, why don't we all just support him instead of protecting him...I thought, but that would be admitting Sushiro's claim, so you don't want to do that. I still wonder if the people who are covering for him are saying ""I would/do that much too""?",1,1
"The amount of compensation claimed is only 67 million yen, but no judgment has been issued yet.",1,1
"It's cheap, because you'd need millions just to build one of these stores. If it's enough to pay for the house and the land, my parents will collect the money from my relatives and pay it all in one lump sum and be done with it.",2,2
I hope that a heavy sentence and more textbooks will reduce the number of similar cases.,1,2
"The commentators get paid for their good-natured, good-natured comments, and they don't want to make enemies, so they gather non-experts, amateurs, and comedians on the dais.",1,1
"I agree 100%, well said. I applaud you because I've been so cynical about the media and commentators lately. Young people, read this article and look at yourself.",1,1
"Everyone is so strict in these comment forums, but everyone is so lenient with children where I can see them... No one pays attention to children frolicking in the streets or on trains.",2,1
"＞A former baseball player and TV personality is reported to have spoken about the rehabilitation of juveniles, saying, ""One way is to have them do menial, or backstage work,"" and ""From the perspective of nurturing and educating juveniles (if Sushiro helps them rehabilitate themselves), it will enhance their image. It's Nagashima Nisei, isn't it? There's no need to hide it because he's already been beaten to a pulp on the Internet. It is nothing more than a frivolous idea of a naive young lad who panders to self-proclaimed intellectuals.",2,1
"You don't have to cover for them. Sure, it would be a bad deal overseas. They put corporate values first, so they will not be sympathetic to any act that undermines the trust of the company.",3,1
"As a democracy, I believe the law is absolute. If it is a crime in light of that law, then it should bear the appropriate guilt.",1,1
"The people who spread the video without the permission of Sushiro or Yarareta should also be punished. As it is now, the people who spread the video are the ones who benefit from it, and the heroic treatment is dangerous.",26,2
"If you want, you can charge the actual costs, right? The damages being offered are not even 1% of the cost of the countermeasures. What are you talking about when you've been ""compensated""? If you're going to cry about it, just don't do it.",2,1
"Yes! I can't believe they are charging an amount they can't possibly pay! I heard a comment from someone who said, ""I can't believe you're charging me an amount I can't possibly pay! I thought to myself. Is it wrong to only charge an amount that can be easily paid? We should charge a fair amount that is commensurate with the damage, right? If anything, I'm conscientious, Sushiro-san!",1,1
"Why is it that other countries have 600 million and our country has 60 million? 1/10 Japan's awareness of sin is too low! Some of them are of the opinion that even 60 million is too much, but their sense is quite off from the rest of the world.",1,2
"By the time you reach the upper grades of elementary school, you will know what you can and cannot do in the world. I think it is time to stop saying that because he is a boy, he should be forgiven.",1,1
I want to make sure that I am responsible (indemnified) for what I have caused. Do you think you can pay for it with the daily life liability insurance of your car insurance or fire insurance?,1,1
"The perpetrator is a juvenile, so we should forgive him? There are a lot of adults with families and children working at Sushiro who have suffered billions of dollars in damages. Can't you even think about that?",3,1
"It seems to me that if the perpetrator were to raise money through crowdfunding, saying, ""This is the cost I need for my rehabilitation, please,"" the amount of money would be raised quickly.",1,1
"I think we should charge a billion dollars. At the very least, the judiciary should be asked not to discount the price.",4,2
"...Why does the media defend the perpetrator? The media gets advertising revenue by having people see their articles and watch TV. If they have the same opinion as everyone else, they will not be seen. That is why they defend unusual opinions.",1,1
"I'm not defending him one millimeter, but do you have a concrete source for what you say that foreign countries would have a different order of magnitude? Is the compensation only for the boy who perforated it? I think the guy who was there and filmed it and spread the word is just as guilty.",1,2
"It has nothing to do with liberalism. I think people don't like it because it is un-Japanese (like a certain country) to know that there is such a clientele, not to have taken countermeasures, and then to act like it is your fault if you get burned. At least, I don't like it. As a company.",1,1
"If a minor did something and the stadium was out of service for a while and several games were cancelled, can Kazushige forgive the person who did it for just ground maintenance?",1,3
"If it were 300 or 400 million, I would think it would be impossible to pay, but 67 million is an amount that can be paid if one is frugal and works steadily.",2,1
"The son of an honorary lifetime coach of a certain Giants team said that it is one thing for the victimized party to make efforts to rehabilitate the perpetrator, but I wondered what he was talking about.",1,1
"I think that's a cheap amount of compensation for a case that's hard to balance, but I'm guessing leaving food (condiments) out on the table from the start wasn't good either.",1,1
"The media's opinion is making society crazy. First, they should be made to take proper responsibility. After that, we should consider rehabilitation.",2,1
"It must be because Sushiro is a black company. They are being criticized. The employees who are angry are also being cheaply exploited for their labor. Normally, they would change jobs.",1,1
"Because those who call themselves ""human rights groups"" are the same people who still say that the dead have no human rights, but the perpetrators do, and therefore it is wrong for the state to take their lives, and the TV stations are the ones who use them.",2,1
">""How can you say that because the perpetrator is a juvenile, we should all take care of him?"" In the first place, children should be taken care of by society. >A former baseball player and TV personality said, ""One way is to have them do menial jobs, or backstage duties,"" but liberals don't say this kind of thing. The Self-Defense Forces are there to train the young people. But liberals don't say this. The mass-produced liberal bashing is troubling because the liberals have a poor understanding of liberalism.",1,1
"I'm sure it's not the wrong thing to do at all, it's a deterrent and now there are no more videos of pranks on restaurants, and what I personally don't agree with is that the person who filmed it should be punished as well.",1,1
"But, then, can you pay back 67 million yen by working as a dishwasher?",3,1
Japanese medias tend to defend the perpetrators. Please fight the companies thoroughly. We must not let the same mistake happen again.,1,1
"The fact that the company determined that the damage claim was 67 million yen, the fact that the store floor is under pressure to take various preventive measures, the fact that Kazushige Nagashima said, ""Why don't you just have them do menial jobs,"" all of these things are lumped together and blamed on the media.",2,1
I think the media people don't want to be harsh because they don't know when they will be on the other side. It's a beautiful spirit of reciprocity.,5,1
"Yeah, but if you're going to write an article with this content, I'd like you to mention what Sushiro's president said in a Youtube interview with Holliemon.",1,1
I think a judicial decision is necessary to prevent the same thing from happening in the future.,1,1
This is the first great article I've seen in a long time. I especially agree with Talent's disrespect for dishwashing and backstage work.,1,1
"They will raise their own ""rating"" by covering for you. If that is the case, why don't you give them some money, even if it's just a comp. I wish they would look at the current social situation and think about it.",1,1
"Why don't the newspapers and the media just shoulder the burden? If people with an average annual income of 15 million yen put together a fund, wouldn't this compensation be a small price to pay?",1,2
"If we don't file a claim for tens of millions of yen in damages, the same thing will happen again in the future. It will be like a show-and-tell, but I think it is appropriate.",1,3
"That is the Japanese temperament and kindness, isn't it? I felt that Sushiro-san was also conflicted about the amount of money. I think people are quick to compare themselves with other countries.",1,2
"Was there a media outlet that was that protective? Did you hear anything about helping them get rehabilitated? I don't understand what the article is trying to say. I don't understand the point of looking at the amount of compensation for restaurants as a whole, and it's pointless to compare it to foreign countries that have different attitudes toward compensation and abundance. It's just meddling for an outsider to make a fuss about the inadequacy of Sushiro's decision. You complain in most of your sentences, and then at the end, you praise Sushiro. Incoherent.",2,2
"Yes, if it were in a foreign country, the bill would be much more in the order of magnitude. Japan is too kind. Not only this girl, but everyone who has ever caused a riot at a sushi restaurant should be charged.",1,1
"Japanese liberals are shallow. It's just a bunch of media-exposed busybodies who don't understand Rawls, the Greek classics, etc., and who seem to be intellectuals, doing whatever they want.",1,1

"As was evident in the case of Mr. Janney's sexual assault, the distortion of some media's sense of justice is quite bad. One can only assume that ratings and circulation numbers are more important than justice and victims.",2,1
"You say that people look down on dishwashers and caregivers, but isn't that strange given the pay scale? It seems to me that the public sees it that way.",2,1
"For the media, they don't care about the actual damage, as long as they can get ratings by producing a ""pitiful, beautiful story"" that will please their viewers, and they don't care about what happens after that.",3,1
"Many people try to escape by blaming everything on the times. It is really hard to live. They may be the victims, but it is also the people of today who created it. And when confronted with reality, they show no sign of remorse. It's appalling.",1,1
The TV station should only report the fact that the damages are 67 million yen. There is no need to send out information about the poor assailant or anything like that.,2,1
"16 billion loss on stock price, 67 million is an unbelievable low price to charge more after having to deal with this matter.",1,2
"67 million is very cheap, I thought. Billions of yen is reasonable when you consider the lost sales, the expenses, the write-down of the stock price, and everything else. Japan is really soft on perpetrators. The human rights group that speaks from a high place is the evil one.",1,1
Liberals say pretty things where they can't harm themselves. I think you should hire him at your place if you are going to talk like that.,2,2
"I would like to see that major media claim, be specific. This article is a little too general. I can get a more realistic advocacy argument if you write which company.",1,1
"Huh? If you don't agree, it's not the amount of compensation, it's the fact that you don't know if they are also claiming compensation from the people who were present with the Perot boys! They caused 16 billion in damages, so I think 70 million each would be fine!",2,1
The argument about compensation (atonement) or rehabilitation is wrong in the first place. It is only good if you rehabilitate yourself after atoning for your sins.,17,1
They are going to fight in court that 67 million yen in damages is too high. I wonder if that would end up being 10% of 6.7 million yen or 20% of 13 million yen.,1,1
"Think about the future of the boy who did this to you. Or so I've heard, there are programs that claim something like that, but there's no place to follow what happened to the perpetrator as a result.",1,1
Kazushige... It's no wonder he speaks without thinking. There is no one more natural and bad quality than a person who has lived a life in a small village without any inconvenience. He thinks I'm generous.,1,1
"I was even surprised that it was so cheap. The damage to Sushiro was outrageous, so please take more. You are too kind.",1,1
I am not against damages. Of course. The only problem is that people who have nothing to do with it are beating them up too much and bumping into the school.,1,1
"Those who complain about Sushiro and say that the compensation for the injured party is pitiful and that they should be given welfare benefits must of course be willing to shoulder the compensation decided in court and donate more than that to be used for welfare benefits, right? If you can't do it, don't say it so lightly!",1,2
Japan is a special country in the eyes of the whole world.... Japanese mass media is really biased in their reporting.,3,1
"Civil damages. If there is no ability to pay this time, the guardian will just pay. The guardian will contest the category of supervisory responsibility. It is ridiculous to complicate and report a simple case.",2,1

This was a very honest article. Excellent writing. Thank you for a straightforward article in this age of extreme human rights groups.,2,2
"In the U.S., where lawsuits are a big business, the damages would be at least a few hundred million dollars, or even several billion dollars.",3,2

"As a general statement in this type of case, when there is an overheated tone that excessively blames the perpetrator, it is okay to have a news report that questions that. It is not right to say that such reports are ""defending only the perpetrators. If the media usually report in such a way, then when the public opinion is leaning toward a tone of defending only the perpetrators, they will report from the angle of ""Is that really the case? I think it is necessary to do so. I think that is necessary.",48,620
"Few people are defending the juvenile's crime itself. The concern is that the juvenile may become overly depressed when he is sentenced to 67 million yen in compensation in addition to social sanctions. In the first place, it is very likely that the 67 million yen will not be repaid. There is also the Labor Standards Law, so no matter how much compensation is awarded, he cannot be made to work more than 40 hours per week without an emergency requirement. I think the amount of compensation should be around the amount obtained by multiplying the monthly amount that can be repaid while leading a cultural life with the average wage earned from a 40-hour workweek by the number of months that should be allotted for repayment. The dispute may be over how many months or years to determine the ""number of months to be used to repay the loan.",35,1173
"The fact that he is a minor, or that his rehabilitation is important, are irrelevant to the person who was harmed. If it is your family members, you have done something that cannot be contained at the level of inconvenience to a completely unrelated company. The country should be able to make a claim for compensation for damages like other countries do. I think it would be more effective in deterring crime to eliminate the tendency for underage behavior to be tolerated, rather than to make corporate efforts. By making people aware that wrongdoing is a crime regardless of age, and that appropriate punishment will be meted out, similar incidents can be prevented to some extent in the future. Whether or not rehabilitation is included in the punishment is another matter. However, it is absurd to make them work backstage. Customers don't want to go to a store where someone like that is working.",2,1
"Sushi restaurants have done nothing wrong. They intentionally poured their saliva into the soy sauce, which the sushi restaurant must provide free of charge, and they intentionally contaminate the product that could be someone else's sushi, which they do not eat themselves, with their saliva. And they are even more self-centered in their attempts to become popular by making a video of this act itself. 67 million is a fair amount for an act that shows no consideration for others. I hope that he will fulfill his responsibility by relying on his parents and siblings. I hope that he will suffer enough so that he won't give birth to such a stupid person in the future.",1,1
"I think it's a problem that too many people think of the restaurant side as inferior because they are customers, and the people who pay to be served are even. The person who is paid to provide the service and the person who is paid to receive the service should accept the crime seriously, pay the compensation, and do service work to appeal to prevent others from doing the same thing in the future.",2,1
"I don't think it is clear what happened to the parents in this case, but no matter how well they educate their children, there will always be a certain number of children who misbehave and commit crimes, and their parents cannot continue to monitor them 24/7. I think that means that there will be a number of cases in the future where families will be destroyed by high compensation. I would never have children because I can't say that I can educate my children to never do this, so I don't know if I will ever have children. It is a sure way to cut off the risk from the source. The government seems to actively support child-rearing, but those who are not confident in their ability to raise children properly should still not have children. As these opinions express, Japanese society is not tolerant but seeks punishment, so you can't take back a shot out of the box.",2,1
"Sushiro is the victim, so I have no problem with Sushiro denouncing the boy alone. However, it would be different if a third party were to go after the boy. It is also true that there are too many crazy people who call the school to complain, identify the home and make it public, or even get information about the family and harm others. The tendency to punish individuals on their own needs to be changed, even though it is the judiciary that judges.",2,1
"I think there is nothing we can do for a child who cannot judge right from wrong, but this is a high school student, and although there may be a juvenile law, I think a fair judicial decision should be made and the victim should not have to be rehabilitated. It seems that this high school student is being made an example of, but I think that the other people who committed the nuisance should also be judged and compensated for their actions.",1,1
"Human society exists because many people observe rules and manners, and as a result, they are protected by rules. When they break rules and manners, they are sure to be harmful to human society in the future.",1,1
"I think the perpetrator should be given a chance for rehabilitation. On the other hand, I also think that they should be punished and compensated appropriately for the severity of the crime they committed. Making light of the crime does not lead to rehabilitation. On the other hand, pushing an offender to the point of ruining his or her life will not lead to rehabilitation. In my opinion, sanctions and reparations should be appropriate so that the offender feels pain but can still manage to lead a reasonable life in society. This is because society will eventually have to support the juvenile and his/her family if his/her life is ruined. Also, if the sanctions and compensation are too heavy and the society becomes hostile to the juvenile, there may be more troublesome issues than just supporting the juvenile.",3,1
"It is a deserved article. The Sushiro side is only a victim. They have been damaged, and they are claiming compensation. It is only natural. Sushiro has no need to do anything at all to the perpetrator, even if they want to rehabilitate themselves. And high school students are already at an age where they should know what not to do. We should be thankful to Sushiro, even though the price could have been higher.",2,1
"Many of those who defend the perpetrators of these acts are not themselves directly affected. If this damage is done poorly, the store risks losing customers and eventually closing. In such a case, the future of the employees of the affected store should be protected first, rather than the future of the perpetrator alone. It does not matter if the perpetrator is a minor. Some of the employees are the same age as the assailant, and some have younger children.",1,2
"The perpetrator has a future because he is a minor, and anyone who says this is exceptionally stupid. I heard the same line not only in this case but also in the bullying issue. Although no lives were lost this time, there are victims who committed suicide due to bullying, and the stupidity of people who say such things is immeasurable. Punishment for the perpetrators is absolutely necessary, and it is about time that the bullies are institutionalized so that the bullies are transferred to a different school.",2,2
"I don't think it's a bad idea, because they actually did a lot of damage. Even if what they did was not worth paying for. In fact, the damage was done to restaurants all over the country. To be honest, I don't think even other conveyor-belt sushi restaurants should be sued. All conveyor-belt sushi restaurants were affected. It is unreasonable to pay the money. Even in the case of a car accident, even if it is 9 to 1 the other party's fault, if the other party's car is a luxury car, the amount of money paid may be higher on our side. It is not about the fine for the wrongdoing, but about the amount of damage caused. So, you have to accept it. You have to accept it.",1,3
"It may seem harsh, but it is obvious that if there is a perpetrator, there is a victim. If we ignore the court system, I think private punishment would be fine. For example, I think molestation offenders need to have their hands cut off at the wrists, and Sushiro lickspittle men need to have their tongues cut off, or some other form of misogi. After that, if they start to return to society, I would be satisfied.",1,1
"I'm a defender, and the reason is clear. I am a defender because there is no malicious intent in this case, unlike murder, robbery, assault, bullying, and other crimes with strong malicious intent. However, even so, in the case of a traffic accident, for example, compensation must be paid to the victim even if there is no malicious intent, so a certain amount of compensation may be unavoidable in this case as well.",3,4
"Putting aside the amount of damage, I hope that Sushiro will not lose its stance of ""fighting the case thoroughly"" now that it has filed a claim for compensation. Fortunately, the boy's side also seems to be in a position to fight the case, so I don't think they will accept a settlement in the middle of the case. Every time the progress of the trial is reported, it serves as a deterrent. It is the ""liberals,"" those who lean to the left, who always take the side of the perpetrators, completely ignoring the reality of the victims, their damages, and their disappointment. In these damages, they blame the company that suffered the loss, and in criminal trials, they always take the side of the perpetrator and the victim is thoroughly ignored. Even in many death sentences, they take the side of the condemned. Sushiro should not be defeated by such liberals.",1,1
"I too was absolutely stunned when I read the opinion of the boy of the N family. I cannot even begin to describe the shallowness of those who have been biting the shins of their great parents since their school days and have no idea what it is like to live on their own, and how many victims they have discouraged! And to top it all off, these perpetrators don't work hard, they resent the system, and there is no telling what they will do.　I think it is infinitely difficult to provide welfare for these people, but why don't the N family's little boy make the most of his parents' support and try to run a welfare facility?",2,2
"You say you are upholding social ethics, so you are admitting that you are punitive. It is enough for the boy to pay for the equipment he soiled. Other than that, the society that caused the hysteria must take responsibility itself. This is rooted in the overreaction to coronas and radiation. Society is hurting itself by losing its rationality and exploding with emotion. Japanese society must regain its rationality. I hope that the courts will not pander to the emotions of the people, but rather assess the damage directly caused by the juvenile. This would be in the best interest of Japan. The people of Japan should take the initiative in maintaining social order by taking precautions when they see such children, rather than blaming others for the possibility of copycats.",3,2
"The only thing I wish is that the judiciary would have a decent judiciary. It is up to the parents to rehabilitate this perpetrator, not the company as the victim.",1,1
"Criminals should be treated as criminals, even if they are minors. The reason is that he is not willing to reform himself in the first place. Japan is too lenient on criminals. He should be punished thoroughly.",1,3
"I believe that Sushiro's giving birth to the Peropero man is a divine punishment for the illegal business practices it had been engaged in right up to the last minute, such as falsifying the place of production, cheating on ingredients, half-price beer scams, and other organized vices that had made it possible for the company to make a fortune. However, I believe that the Peropero man is guilty of causing enormous damage to investors rather than to store employees by causing the instantaneous collapse of the stock price. In that sense, 67 million yen is far too lenient. I am not a shareholder, but I feel that Sushiro needs to consider not only the damage to the stores, but also the investors. On the other hand, there are statements in the media that seem to defend the livelihood of the employees working in the stores, but I am sure that the employees knew that the entire store had been deceiving the employees until just before the half-price beer campaign, at least the deceitful sales. It is not fair to keep quiet only when they are making a sneaky profit and play the victim only when they are losing money.",1,1
"It is the same as opposing the death penalty. There are still a certain number of people who oppose the death penalty for murderers, perhaps because they want to be considered humane or good people. They can say such things because they are not involved in the case of others. They are irresponsible. Would these people say that they are against the death penalty and hope that the murderer will be rehabilitated and return to society after his death? I feel that Japanese people are too much concerned about how others look at them, and words that are not their true intentions are being used too often. Even welfare is the same. There are a lot of people who do not work and spend their living expenses on bicycle races, horse races, and alcohol to play and live. However, because people think I am a cold person if I criticize them or express my opinion about welfare, I have been moving more and more in the direction of defending the welfare recipients, and here we are. What is wrong is wrong. If we don't make a clear distinction between what is wrong and what is right, we will end up in a world that will be irreversible.",1,1
"Whether it is minors or the elderly, Japan spoils everything too much. Many people misunderstand their freedom and responsibility as individuals, and their social rights and obligations, which leads to unreasonable situations in social security, traffic problems, and other such areas. One punishment is one hundred commandments. If we don't make them understand the right and wrong of their actions, similar incidents will happen again and again.",1,2
"I don't think there is any need to give consideration to the perpetrator boy there, since it is described as a nuisance but it is simply a criminal act. Of course, he should be given a chance for rehabilitation, but it should be given to him by society, not by the victim.",1,1
"For employees, you can put a clause in the employment contract that says, ""If you do anything wrong, you will be liable for more than 100 million yen in damages,"" but you can't make customers feel constrained by such a clause. Their main purpose is to protect their employees and the company, and for that purpose, they are taking measures to deliver safety and security to their customers. Since this means has been interfered with, there can be no mercy. It is up to the store manager, area manager, or president to decide whether or not to show warmth. And those of us who are watching the news around us should just ""make sure the same thing doesn't happen around us"". If the store's response is not an act of ""pushing the family around at all hours of the day, threatening them, spreading rumors about them, and taking them down,"" then I think it's fine to just watch and wait. I think it's fine to just watch them without concern, unless they do something humane like ""I did something wrong! Of course! Suck it up!"" I understand the desire to say something like that, and that's the aspect of social networking, but I hope people realize that their righteous comments are just self-satisfaction.",1,1
"This article also lacks calm. What is the proper scope of responsibility for the perpetrator, the juvenile, to pursue? Material damage is in the hundreds of yen range, since cleaning and destruction are sufficient. Most of the damage is caused by the spread of the video. The video was not shot, uploaded, and spread by the boy himself. It is not usually appropriate for the boy to bear most of the responsibility for the video. In addition, this case is a manifestation of a potential hygiene risk in the self-serve system. Although the juvenile's actions were responsible for the loss of trust in the company by society, which could have occurred at any restaurant, it is the company that provides customers with such service in the first place, and it is not appropriate for the juvenile to bear responsibility for that as well. I am not trying to defend the perpetrator, but from a logical point of view, it is appropriate that the juvenile should be reimbursed for the damage caused by his actual behavior and the inconvenience limited to it.",1,1
"With the proliferation of social networking sites, I feel that the impact and damage caused by rather silly things is overwhelmingly inflated. If we only look at the act itself, it is something that a slightly bad child in the world would do, and I feel that the degree of sanction is more serious than violence or sex crimes.",1,1
"Social sackings are slanderous depending on the content of the comment, so please don't do it. The Japanese constitution is a constitution, so I don't think imitating foreign countries is right. Europe is more concerned with human rights, so how can I compare with any other country? There is no social slap-on-the-wrist punishment in the first place. Divorce courts are too expensive to get money just because foreign countries do it this way. I don't know about that. In the first place, a trial is not a place to beat the other party to a pulp. I think it's a place to make things right in a quiet manner. You can't have a trial based on emotionalism alone. It should be based on the law,",1,1
"This compensation would be profitable enough to terrorize people for shorting stocks. If multiple companies outside of Japan are the main culprits, they will no longer be found out. The recent frogs are also becoming more and more suspicious. In addition to punitive damages, there will be no end in sight unless we can determine the relationship between the person or corporation that profited from the stock price. This means that we will be too scared to buy stocks of food-related companies. They should also bear the guilt for the stock market as a whole.",1,2
"If he had not licked the soy sauce jug from the beginning, none of this would have happened, and the seeds he planted in the first place would have sprouted and made him and his family a goose chase. If the victimized company wants to encourage others who have caused similar incidents to file similar claims, I would actively support it.",2,1
"It is very important to rehabilitate the perpetrator, but only after he or she has been cleared of the crime. If the person is rehabilitated without punishment, he or she will only feel ""lucky. What liberals call rehabilitation is intended to reduce the damage to the offender by lightening the punishment, leading to his reintegration into society, but it is not true rehabilitation.",2,1
"When I first saw the claim amount of 67 million yen, I was surprised at how cheap it was. Normally, I think 6.7 billion yen would be appropriate, but it means that Sushiro has taken a very conscientious measure. Nevertheless, I was also quite surprised to hear that the Peropero boys were going to fight the case in court.",1,2
"Rehabilitation by washing dishes is a concept that is typical of Japanese society, which has a soft spot for offenders. It is said that the parents are in a position to fight with Sushiro, and there is no such thing as ""rehabilitation"" when the crime has not been atoned for. If the parents would show that they are willing to sacrifice themselves to atone for their sins, not just ""washing dishes,"" the boy's heart might be moved a little.",1,3
"I'm sorry to say that 90% of people would never do such a thing, and it's not because of their youth, but because there are people of all ages who would do such an unthinkable thing. It doesn't matter if they are in their teens or not, and it's natural that the victims should work to recover their losses instead of trying to rehabilitate themselves.",1,1
"I can't defend these boys, and I don't have to; after 10 years of age, you know when something is right or wrong, and even my dog looks up at me when I play tricks on him. And, the former baseball commentator is so far removed from the general public living in Hawaii that he has probably never been to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant in his life. The company may have to reduce hourly wages and bonuses if the market value of the sushi restaurant is reduced by 16 billion yen. And I despise former baseball commentators who, without much thought, offer silly opinions on how they should be made to wash dishes.",1,1
"I saw a man in a street interview about this compensation and he said it was too much for the amount. What is he saying if he won't get the full amount of compensation? It's the amount of money that proves that they did what they did. The company knows that it is difficult to prove the causal relationship between the decline in sales, and that they will not get the full amount. It depends on the case, but the perpetrators in this case are perpetrators in every way. The fact that he is a minor has nothing to do with the company. Blaming the victim, blaming the victim, blaming the victim, blaming the victim, blaming the victim.",2,1
"As for why the mass media is protecting the perpetrator in this case, the boy himself does not have the ability to pay the 67 million yen in compensation, and his parents will have to pay on his behalf, which is not an amount that an average family can easily afford.　Furthermore, everyone understands that what the boy did is an unforgivable crime, and it is clear that even the media is not defending him in this regard. I think it is a sympathetic defense of the family that was involved in the behavior that led to the boy's destruction.",1,1
"Dishwashing"" would have been possible in the poor Showa era. A poor boy, always hungry, gets too hungry, smells something good, and goes into a restaurant and eats without paying. The owner of the restaurant is angry at first, but when he learns about the boy's situation, he hires him and says, ""Come work at my restaurant and start by washing dishes,"" but in the case of the Peropero boy, he just wanted to be popular with his friends. I don't think the company needs to save him. The boy's face is still exposed on the Internet if you look for it, and I don't think there are any companies that will hire him, but the boy will have to steadily pay for the damages.",1,1
"I don't mean to defend the Peropero boy, but the friends who filmed him, the friends who posted it on social media, the friends who were present and did not stop him, they are all equally guilty. So I think we should all share the blame and pay compensation. The damage would not have occurred if it had not spread and flared up. Even before social networking services spread to junior high and high school students, there were probably many cases of pranks between friends like this. People do not change suddenly. I hope that these boys are not the first, nor will they be the last, to learn a lesson: if you post videos on social networking sites too easily, this is what you will get.",2,1
"Rather than defending the perpetrator, I believe that human beings must forgive at the end of their lives. If we don't, we become the same as the perpetrator. Just like animals. In a sense, claiming compensation is a very good way to solve the problem with money. It is a tremendous amount of money for the average person, but you have to work like hell to pay it back. You will understand the victims through their hardship and suffering.　You say you are defending them, but if there is no one to help them, this world will become a hell where the strong win. Emotion and forgiveness are only human.",2,1
"As for Nagashima, he is a typical boy, so he may not have washed dishes or cleaned by himself. Even at home, he may have had a housekeeper or a servant to take care of him. It is a pity that he is treated as if he is being punished for his good birth and his hard work that has allowed him to have a life as an adult without having to clean and do dishes. In the first place, it is a fundamental mistake for an entertainer who has caused a scandal to say ""I'm working as a cleaner or a caregiver"" as a form of purification. as a form of purification is a fundamental mistake. It is a good evidence that he thinks that his position in society is low or that his job is frowned upon. This is a leap forward, but I think the social structure is wrong in that the position of essential workers is low, and only billboards such as youtubers, models, and celebrities are treated well.",1,1
"Restaurants in national chains should understand that since credit issues and image are important, the impact on attracting customers from such an unsolicited video distribution is significant and the damage is not half as great as it could be. There is also a significant impact on the stock price and damage to many shareholders. As a reminder and a reminder of the foolishness of not being able to imagine how much of a ripple effect a single storefront nuisance can have, I think even 67 million yen is a small amount to pay. The perpetrators and their families should pay with their lives.",1,1
"No, I have not defended the perpetrators from the beginning and I don't think I have to in the future. Since the defense of the perpetrators has increased, there are more and more people who are playing tricks all over the place. If we defend this kind of thing, sooner or later there will be a bigger case of poisoning, allergic substances, etc. intentionally mixed in, and diseases will spread. If discipline cannot be expected at school or at home, the only way is to bind them heavily with the law. It's not that I don't like children, but an undisciplined child is no better than a wild beast. It is a beast with a working brain. You should imagine the horror of ordinary wild beasts being exterminated, but a smart beast being left unchecked.",1,2
"In any case, the district court will probably give him a minor charge on the grounds that he has already received sufficient social sanctions for ""being expelled from high school,"" ""having his face publicized around the world,"" and ""having his privacy violated in the press. The company would not be able to afford to go to the high court and the Supreme Court for such a case, so it would be realistic to settle the case for an amount that can be paid without going bankrupt (several million yen that can be paid in a lump sum, since there is a high possibility of escaping if the payment is made in installments). It is realistic to settle the case for the amount that can be paid without bankruptcy. In the first place, the Japanese judicial system and laws themselves are designed to be strict on the victim and gentle on the offender. However, the realistic settlement is not the same as taking a tough attitude toward nuisance acts.",1,2
"I'm a layman, not a lawyer, but I wonder if the issues are: the appropriateness of the amount of damage to Sushiro and the appropriateness of the social sanctions. I know they say that the stock price has dropped dramatically, but I wonder what kind of real damage has been caused by that. I can understand if it was possible to hire such a gun-toting person as a part-timer and make them do peropero on purpose to make the stock price drop and take over the company, but I don't think there is any mention of that. The second is that they are claiming for damages in order to check the appearance of the second generation of this assailant.",1,2
"This is natural. Don't take it for granted. It is a matter of course. Japan is on the verge of an end itself for an article like this to appear. It is precisely because there are those who cannot foresee the gravity of the situation that we must show it to them. This is what happens. If it were not necessary, there would be no one who cannot foresee the seriousness of the situation. There is an old saying, ""If they don't understand what you say, make them learn it with their bodies,"" but it was not born out of thin air. That is how human beings are. It is only when they are hurt that they stop doing it. It is the basis for living creatures to survive on the earth.",3,1
"The judiciary is the primary prerequisite for judging. It is a nation governed by the rule of law, nothing less, nothing more. This is not the same as dealing with bad kids in the Showa Era, but it is about the impact of social networking. I would like to see the law governing social networking to be properly enforced in order to establish a legal standard. I don't want to see a reduction in sentence for being underage or having been socially sanctioned. Otherwise, there is too much to be gained or lost.",1,1
"I guess those who defend it are those who can only think with their emotions and want to gain the sympathy of such people. Mainly TV...decent people don't watch TV anymore. People who watch TV are people who cannot think logically and can only judge everything on their own account. That's why TV programs only make comments that are emotionally sympathetic, without regard to logic or law. They don't care about right and wrong. It's basic entertainment. But people who lack thinking skills watch TV and think it is right. This widens the gap, doesn't it? In many ways. The same goes for those who oppose the digitalization of insurance cards. They only see the immediate future. They have no idea what is behind it. They are foolish people. If they had the intelligence to think about such things even a little, they would notice the discomfort and naturally stay away from TV. That's how it is.",1,1
"Frankly, I think it's cheap. Whether it's admissible is another matter, but I think the bill should be much higher. Juvenile or adult, they know the difference between good and bad, and if they do something wrong, they should be punished accordingly. The result of being too soft is a world in which the perpetrators say that even if they do something wrong, they are protected by the Juvenile Law because they are minors.",1,2
"Since he caused damage to the company, it is only natural that he should be compensated, even if the culprit is a juvenile. The fact that the offender voluntarily dropped out of high school or is remorseful is not a reason not to claim compensation. Liberal politicians have been insisting on an abnormally lenient sentence, saying that the rehabilitation of the offender is important and that he or she has a future, but this attitude of pampering criminals has greatly encouraged crimes. Once, a young boy who was a heinous criminal in the Hikari mother and child murder case killed two people, and yet he bragged that if he stayed quiet in prison, he would come out of the shadows in a few years. The family members of the victims questioned this, and it was their efforts that led to a fundamental change in the way juvenile crimes were handled. It is still fresh in our memories that the judiciary, entrenched in vested interests and precedent-setting, never attempted to change anything on its own.",1,1
"It is outrageous for a TV personality to talk about the rehabilitation of a juvenile on a TV Asahi wide show. For example, would the same thing be said if the boy had broken the dominant arm of a professional baseball player in a prank? Would he say, ""It is one thing to let him play or bat in a game,"" or ""From the perspective of nurturing and educating the boy (if the baseball team helps him rehabilitate himself), it will improve his image""? Neither the player whose arm was broken nor the team that suffered the loss would be convinced of such a thing. A little bit of thought would have revealed that what he is saying is not correct, but I guess he does not have that level of intelligence.",2,1
"Not only in this case, but I often see a strange reversal of the situation, where the human rights of the victim are not taken into consideration while only the rights of the perpetrator are taken into consideration as if they were a tumor. Even when it comes to gender issues, there are a certain number of people (in a sense, victims) who are physiologically impossible to deal with, and the tendency to view these people as human pests is clearly wrong.",2,2
"I don't understand why you are defending Pero Pero boy. The amount of money offered by Sushiro is also small. It could have been more severe. You must think it's easy to do whatever you want because of the juvenile law, don't you? Peropero juvenile needs to understand more the magnitude and weight of the crime of what he did. He doesn't need to be defended, and he shouldn't be. It is not better for this child to be protected by the juvenile law by defending him. If one commits a crime, one must pay the price for the magnitude and gravity of the crime and receive the appropriate punishment. There is no point in rehabilitating a person if you coddle him or her.",2,1
"Many people feel that if they are dealing with a large company, they will not do anything because they are concerned about various things, or they think that the customer is in a higher position than them, and they may have been able to get away without much concern. What should be lamented is the nerve of people who spread this kind of thing on video without hesitation. At the very least, they don't understand that it's wrong or what will happen as a result... And there are many more like that... At least the pranksters and yankees of the past were aware that they were doing something wrong. I think they were at least aware that they were doing something wrong. I guess those who don't understand what's wrong with them become the end of the Oleore scam and robberies without a care.",1,1
"I've heard both sides of the argument, but the social sanctions are as severe as ever, and if there were no one to defend him, it would be a mass lynching, and some might say he got what he deserved, but he's being sued for compensation, and the rest should be left to the judiciary, even if there are people who really want to defend him. I'd like to ask him what he thinks about the immigration reform bill that's being talked about right now, not this case.",2,1
"I, too, think it is a plausible article. Well, no matter how much the media and the celebrity side of things defend it, the public won't forgive it. Good or bad, ""personal sanctions"" will not be tolerated in today's Internet society. And no matter how many defensive comments a celebrity makes, they will not be compensated. The more defensive articles and opinions you express, the more the real world moves in the opposite direction. That's all ""Peropero Boy"" has done. Even if he can hide himself and work in the future, he will be found out someday. He will probably be fired in some way that doesn't violate the law. Some people feel sorry for this boy because he is an example, but to put it bluntly, he is an example. You will have to live with this for the rest of your life. This is the real world.",1,1
"Since there is no way to determine that the boy is at fault, I guess the question is how much punishment is appropriate, but the issue of cleanliness depends on each person's sense of cleanliness, so it is difficult to reach a consensus. However, I think the court will only accept a very low amount even if you demand 67 million yen. Because all he did was to lick a soy sauce pot. I think it would be a million yen at most, maybe a few hundred thousand yen in reality. I know there are many people who would not be satisfied with that.",2,1
"Certainly Sushiro, which is also in a situation where mischief can be played, is at fault! It is inevitable that minors will play! That should be taken into consideration in the operation of the restaurant!",1,8
"If you want to defend them, please set up a fundraising site and collect 67 million yen for compensation. That would make sense, but these people have forced us to change our lives as well. I hope they will live with their sins for the rest of their lives. Otherwise, there will be a second and third perpetrator. If the media does not inform people that they will be charged for damages if they commit this kind of terrorism, we will see a repeat of the part-time terrorist attacks at convenience stores and restaurants that happened a few years ago.",2,2
"I really think it could be a lot higher, but I don't think he can pay the bill. I would rather take out a large amount of life insurance and have Sushiro receive the money...There are many who are really defending Sushiro, but because of this kid, Sushiro's sales will plummet, the stock price will drop dramatically...and in addition, shareholders will suffer, and employees' bonuses and salaries will drop as well. Some of their children, who look forward to going to Sushiro once a month for dinner, will no longer be able to go...etc. There are too many sins for what they have done. It really is the devil's work that is destroying people's lives.",1,1
"Peropero is a problem, but the biggest problem is that it was sent out on social networking sites. If it was just peropero, they might have tolerated it, but transmitting on social networking sites is absolutely not allowed because it leads to reputational damage! I think it is a reasonable amount of money because there is no way they can pay a large amount of compensation to an individual.",2,1
"If the direct damage caused by the boy's amused perusing is a dirty soy sauce jug or a piece of sushi, it is a small price to pay. It can be said that the act of posting the video on the Internet for the fun of it caused enormous damage. The cyber police can easily find out who posted the video on the Internet.",1,3
"Peropero boy is going to lose in court and will surely be made to pay compensation. And if Sushiro is going to take a licking, he will just have to do it thoroughly. No matter what the world says, we must not allow this to happen. There is no denying that this boy will pay for the rest of his life, ruin his life, and possibly commit suicide, but he deserves it. I don't know what kind of a person you are talking about dismissing the claim. Those with such a low intelligence quotient can't imagine or think of the consequences of their actions, so we have no choice but to make an example of them.",2,1
I don't go out of my way to go to a restaurant where it is obvious that the boy who committed such acts is working. And baseball players who want to encourage rehabilitation should take action themselves. Let them manage their own affairs or clean their own house. I disagree with the idea of trying to get the victim to rehabilitate himself at the restaurant without doing so.,2,1
"You can charge whatever amount you want, and it is the court that will determine a reasonable amount, so it is strange that you are making a fuss when you are still in the billing stage. And elementary school students can distinguish between right and wrong, and the perpetrators in this case and similar cases are all sneaking around doing malicious pranks while understanding what is wrong. If you don't know the difference between right and wrong, if you don't know what you're doing, you don't need to do it to avoid being noticed by the clerk. I guess the ethereal people are generous enough to laugh and forgive when their stores suffer the same damage.",1,1
"Not only the Peropero boy, but also the person who filmed this video and posted it on the Internet is responsible for increasing the damage, and should claim compensation for the damages. The mass media should report on the details of why Sushiro only claimed damages from the Peropero boy, and report only the facts, eliminating subjectivity.",1,1
"It seems that peninsular countries are kind to the offenders and harsh to the victims, and that it's worse to be the victim. I think that if more demands were made for stopping train service (suicide, pressing the emergency stop button without permission, trespassing on the tracks, etc.), the number of accidental suicides would decrease, even if only by a certain number.",2,1
"The boy said, ""I'm usually sober, but I did it because I was eating out with friends on New Year's Day and got worked up."" He said, ""I'm usually a serious person. The cost was so great that some people are defending him, but I can only think that they are taking it lightly because the target was a piece of equipment or product of a sushi restaurant. If this had been directed at someone else, the result could have been much worse. We must not forget that the accumulation of naive thinking that ""this much is safe"" is the entry point for violent crimes.",2,1
"These problems of annoying and harassing bullies are immature if you're under college age because the perpetrators and the perpetrators with a future don't mean to be malicious because they're just messing around with you! Even adult adults can be stupid as people, and you're not the only one who's been harassed or harassed by someone you don't like! ← Of course, we all may have had some, big or small, but it's a bit of a stretch to be put away by this. And the defense goes to the perpetrator. If there were some circumstances that should be taken into account and the person himself had properly paid up for his negligence, the victim should not be at fault in this nuisance act.",1,1
"I think the article is generally clear and exemplary. However, I wonder if Sushiro is on the completely good side. Don't we all forget that until just a short time before this incident, Sushiro was a company that routinely used ""bait and switch"" advertising as a sales method, a company that did not deserve to be talked about in terms of compliance? Peropero boy did a bad thing. But it is a solid fact that Sushiro is (was?) also a company that licked its customers in the restaurant industry. It is a firm fact that Sushiro is (was?) a company that licked its customers in the restaurant industry. Isn't there something wrong with the public's atmosphere of Sushiro mansplaining?",1,1
"You can't pay your bills anyway. They will go bankrupt and that will be the end of it. The damage done to society, including Sushiro, will never be made up. It will never be restored. If that is the case, at the very least, the government should present the ""amount equivalent to the responsibility"" in order to maximize the ""deterrent effect"" in the future. The government should be willing to compile other damages and present them as a reference. If you want to defend the juvenile, you should make a separate plan to compensate or remedy the damage, and it is out of the question to say ""reduce the amount to what he can pay. A crime is a crime, a punishment is a punishment, and a person is a person. They should not be treated as one. Otherwise, we would be living in a society where people sleep in chairs in their own homes with one eye open.",1,1
"In the first place, why should they be made to wash dishes in the kitchen of Sushiro in order to be rehabilitated? If it's not dishwashing, but other work that many people don't like to do, it doesn't matter where it's done, or even if it's done at Sushiro. There are plenty of jobs that are hard, dirty, and dangerous, so why not have them do them for years?",1,1
"Many of the defenders of peropero are all associated with the old media. Either they don't see things for what they really are and think that hypocritically using kind words will be popular, or they are old and out-of-date, bringing up old standards that were used in the past. The old media that can't change even though more and more young people are moving away from TV because they don't understand it. If there were no vested interests and proper competition, they would be eliminated and they should be. Japan can't move forward because there is no such thing.",1,1
"The basic idea of the liberal media is that the worst is state power. Therefore, the idea is that criminals are poor victims who are punished by state power. An easy one to understand is the suspect Yamakami, who assassinated former Prime Minister Abe, who had become an icon of state power. Despite his worst position as a murderer, he is still considered a hero by those who publicly say, ""I am glad the assassination was successful."" Many people consider him a hero for publicly declaring, ""I am glad the assassination was successful. Kihei Maekawa, former vice minister of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, has also gone from being the ringleader of a corrupt government agency to a liberal who stood up to the state once he realized that Abe's stance was anti-Abe. Kagoike, the Morikake case, also went from being an aberrant educator who believed in the Imperial Rescript on Education to a sorry clown who was abandoned by Abe, and then changed his position and joined his son in completely ignoring the Moritomo story when he said that it was drawn up by Kanno Kan and others. Even though the Asahi Shimbun has fallen, what still dominates public opinion is the WGIP, the self-defeating history of Japan created by GHQ. It is time to rid ourselves of liberal righteousness.",1,1
"What would you do if this matter had resulted in extreme store closures or layoffs? The owner, manager, and staff of that store. And their families. What about the lives of dozens or hundreds of people? What about their human rights? What about guarantees? The lives of those victims who have done nothing wrong are hundreds of times more important than that of one selfish perpetrator, aren't they? Rehabilitation is what parents and prisons do. Let the victims be solemnly rehabilitated, and don't force them to do anything else. If they want to advocate, they can do it on their own. If they want to defend the victims, they should do it on their own. Those who don't do it should stay out of it.",4,1
"This assailant, who didn't receive much punishment as a result of similar videos, is going to do the same thing to himself. Those who are defending the assailant should think about what would happen if they were the victim, and they can only say such admirable things because they are not the victim.",1,1
"Well, the company committed a super-duper terrorist act ""just for the fun of it,"" which drove a nationwide chain store to the brink of closing its business with a single shot, and threatened the lives of thousands of employees and the workload of transportation and other related businesses with a sharp decrease. It's a little too cheap, isn't it? If there was a person who was enjoying taking a video of a rough play that injured the ace of the opposing team in a way that would cost millions of dollars in medical expenses, would you say, ""I should let him be the manager of that team for a while.",1,1
"It is no surprise that Japan's self-proclaimed liberals have been so eager to defend the perpetrators of these crimes. I was stunned when Mr. Hiraoka, a former member of the Rikken Diet, said to the victims' families to their faces, ""The perpetrators have their own reasons.",1,1

"An eye for an eye is the original concept of criminal law. In the Edo period (1603-1867), the maximum penalty was applied from the age of 15, so it is normal to charge 600 million yen, which is quite cheap and could be returned to the parents and children. If you are going to be so merciful as to argue against it, you should increase the amount even more. Generally, these people become adults who are a nuisance to society. If they can't pay, they should be given the maximum punishment. There was a time when stealing 10 ryo would do that, and that was the basis of public safety.",2,1
"The future of the perpetrator is something that the perpetrator himself should think about. If he cannot think of it, there is no future. That is the simplest way. Tens of thousands of people have died socially or biologically in this way. It seems to me that they just want a way to say that the media saved poor me/us from being beaten up on social networking sites.",2,1
"The real perpetrators are the good citizens who don't show up, who are screaming ""pay for the rest of your life,"" ""go to ruin,"" and ""go to hell,"" even though they have nothing to do with the crime. They are always talking about the stock price, which fluctuates constantly, as if it has caused that much damage. Is the stock price still falling? I would like to say, ""Is the stock price still falling? In fact, even the president of Sushiro, the victim, denies that it's nonsense to talk about the stock price, which goes up and down from time to time. In fact, even the president of Sushiro, the victim, denies that it's nonsense to say that the stock price goes up and down from time to time. It has nothing to do with the case, but I'm sure the ""good"" public and others who wish to see other people's misfortune ruined are raising their fists in the air and screaming about it.",2,1
"The only way to get rid of them is to let them do it on their own, and the people around them have to let them do it. Well, check out what Sushiro is going to do about it.",1,1
"Society is different from other countries. In other countries, even if a person commits a crime, he or she is treated as a real human being and must be treated as such, even if he or she goes bankrupt in the case of monetary compensation or serves time in a criminal case. It is not a society like Japan, where a criminal is always and forever pointed back at you. In Japan, honestly, it is useless to be sorry, and if it is money, it is not worth paying. Unless Japanese people become cooler, western style rules are basically useless.",2,1
"Contrast the amount of damages to Mr. Sushiro with the amount of compensation claimed. Also take into account the reputational damage. Then I think it's a double-digit discount price. If you think about rehabilitating the perpetrator, I think you should put him on a tuna fishing boat.",1,1
"Restaurants are in the business of not being able to choose their customers. This has become a common practice throughout the country. Some businesses, such as urban real estate rentals, are very selective about their customers. Restaurants, in particular, are run by incomplete, unaware minors who have never been socially or humanly screened. They are self-centered and destructive minors, and even if they are not minors, they are self-centered and unaware adults. They are cheap and have many customers, but they are not selective. This is everything.",1,1
"No one will say how dangerous this act is, but if the assailant had some kind of infection, it would be terrorism against the customers. If it was an accident, I could defend it a little, but this is something the boy should reflect on himself and get on the right track! Most people have compulsory and voluntary insurance for their cars.",1,1
"I don't know who this former baseball player and TV personality is who spoke about the rehabilitation of juveniles, saying, ""It's one way to have them do menial jobs, or backstage duties,"" and ""From the perspective of nurturing and educating juveniles (if Sushiro helps them rehabilitate), it will enhance their image,"" but his comments, from what he said, everything about him. I don't know who this former baseball player is, but everything he says and everything he does is ridiculous. I don't know who this former baseball player is, but everything he says is ridiculous! No matter what type of job, that is where the professionals do it. Don't talk about it like it's a game of punishment! And why should the victim's side help the perpetrator to rehabilitate? Do you think I'm an idiot! The perpetrator is not only licking the soy sauce jug, but also the world. I don't understand what you mean when you say you are remorseful and ask for the claim to be dismissed. That's not remorse. To be frank, I'd like to say that I'm glad he only got away with 67 million yen. I think the parents are parents, too. If you love your child, make the child pay the 67 million himself. Work hard and earn money to pay for it.",1,1

"Well, even before social networking sites became so popular, there were videos of people trying to make tera-buta-don (or was it beef-don?) or deep-frying a G. If it had been a long time ago, when videos were not so easily available, some of them would have been known only to their friends. But I think it's wrong to say that if you do it behind the scenes, you should be a little warmer about it. A buckwheat noodle shop where a college student played a prank would be destroyed by a long-established store that had worked hard to rebuild its business, and only a small amount of money would be given to the store and that would be it. This time, it was a big chain restaurant, so they were able to hold on, but I wonder if the same can be said for the restaurant that went out of business. On a side note, one of my subcontractors took a picture of a job he did in an unusual place and posted it on a video that only a few people saw, and a few hours later the owner yelled at him in a very strong voice. It seemed that he had taken a picture in an absolutely prohibited area, and top-secret information was vaguely captured in the picture. The video was almost blown up to my company, and orders in the tens of millions were almost blown away. How they found out is a mystery, but you should always be aware that someone is watching.",1,1
"I think the best way to rehabilitate a boy with a future is to ask for compensation. It's not like 67 million will be the end of his life, and he can recover as much as he wants if he is truly rehabilitated and works hard for the rest of his life.",2,1
"I hear the parents say that this child is sorry too, but what these parents should be saying to the world is that they are sorry for raising a child like this. I wonder how uneducated these parents are. Other food terrorism should be dealt with equally severely.",1,1
"This is Japan. When a family is slaughtered and the perpetrator is a juvenile, there are people who seriously say things like ""a way to rehabilitation"" or ""a future for the juvenile"" as if it is a joke. I thought those who say that this is just a prank by a child or that the amount of money is too high are students or NEETs who really don't understand society, but surprisingly, even ordinary adults are saying things like that. It is quite natural, considering the extent of the social impact, the amount of damage caused by each chain store, and the opinions of users. As a parent myself, I feel sorry for the parents of the perpetrators, but I can't help it. I feel sorry for the parents of the perpetrators, but I can't help it. I'll have to do the same for the many others who have done the same thing and spread the word.",3,1
"I must say that it is too lenient to allow a child to be forgiven for something he or she did because it was a prank, just for fun, or for some other reason. Japanese law is soft on perpetrators and indifferent to defending victims. So cunning criminals take advantage of this, and even if they kill or cheat people, they escape punishment because they are juveniles. If the judiciary allows such a thing to go unchecked, social norms will collapse. Japan is no longer a safe place to live.",2,1
"Letting the boy wash dishes may make him understand how hard backstage work is, but it will do nothing to deter the second and third peropero reserve army who are now or will be trying to do the same annoying act. This means that there is no benefit to the victimized store.",1,1
"Remorse, rehabilitation, all of it, only benefits the perpetrators. (A closer look at the Chinese characters shows this.) The subcontractors, even more so than the chain stores, must be more agitated by this incident. If the industry lost hundreds of millions of dollars, if they are not doing well, some of the subcontracting factories must have gone out of business or cannot pay their employees. If there were deaths, it would almost be no different than an act of terrorism. Those who are talking about rehabilitating the perpetrators can only say that because they are on the other side of the fire. If the terrorist who pointed a gun at you was a child, would you call for the rehabilitation of this child even if he was shot and lost his limbs?",1,2
"The actual damage caused by the boy's post alone would not have been as great as it was, and I think the act itself was so thoughtless and foolish that it was not even considered in the first place, but I doubt that the media would report it so extensively day after day. The media picked up the story because they thought it was interesting, and the movement was started by the media, which was spread by all the companies at once. I think the media's reporting attitude is a major factor (the boy is to blame) in the decline in stock prices.",2,2
"It is still too early to talk about the future and rehabilitation, and because we keep talking about such things and protecting them, the number of crimes committed by minors will not decrease, and even remorse will only be a formality, leading to recidivism. Even the self-proclaimed underage murderer, ""Seito Shakira,"" has not shown remorse for his actions, and it should never be the person who does the deed that wins.",1,1
"Why such a tens of millions of yen punishment for just that much mischief? You want to say. Without choosing a word, if someone is not sanctioned as a human pillar, the next one will come out. In fact, it has come up many times until now. The only thing is that the human pillar was him. His sacrifice will reduce the number of fools in the future. Other stores will follow suit. It can only be a good thing for both the customers and the stores. It's good, because they won't even take his life.",1,1
"If you do something wrong, you will be judged, and you deserve to be penalized accordingly. If you allow that to happen, it will only escalate, and you won't be able to put a stop to it. I think it's a natural retribution for those who lick someone's lips when their livelihood depends on it, such as when they get away with it. This is a story that cannot be joked about.",4,1
"I was surprised to see someone come to my defense on a large forum. Well, I think it's the opposite. The crime of making it impossible for us to eat out in peace is a big one. I think they crossed a line they shouldn't have crossed. Because conveyor-belt sushi is built on a foundation of sexual goodness, so they didn't expect someone like this to show up. The mother said she's still sorry, and I thought, oh, here's a parent and here's a child, but I hope she's sorry for the rest of her life.",1,1
"I will defend the Scipero boys. What he did is wrong. I know that. But I think we should not forget that we are taking the option of killing a boy's life for sure. As a company, it is natural to punish the perpetrator. I understand that you don't tolerate tomfoolery! I understand that, but I think the boy who was not a criminal with malicious intent and just happened to be a joke has received enough social sanctions from Japan as a whole. Am I being lenient? If Sushiro had closed the restaurant and cut the staff because of this incident, it would have been a disaster for the company, but... I don't mean to say this, but if you have any compassion, please don't deprive the boy of his life.",2,3
"I, who grew up being taught that if you do something wrong, you will be punished! Do today's parents not discipline their children? Or have they become parents without discipline themselves? The minimum discipline is ""Don't bother others! I think this is universal. Who did this to their children? Did others do this to them? Nowadays, we live in a world where evil things can run a thousand miles! Do you want to stop being human? Is it the role of adults to make sure that children learn about this in their bones, both at school and at home? (Maybe I don't know...)",1,1
"As this article says, it is the neutral judiciary that metes out punishment, so why are these people who are not the victims saying that this is not a private punishment and is a natural measure, that they should be rehabilitated or that the punishment is too severe? Because of such naive talk, stupid parents will always fail to discipline their children strictly, and children will lick adults and commit crimes with impunity.",1,1
"＞He mentioned menial jobs, such as washing dishes, cleaning, and carrying in luggage, etc. To help the assailants, he suggested that they work behind the scenes at the victim's restaurant? I wonder where they got the idea to come up with such a ""fuck you"" line, these people who are supposed to be in the know? Would you put a kid in the kitchen of a restaurant who is willing to do something that will disturb the restaurant and other customers because he ""thought it would amuse everyone""? Are you saying that you want to cause secondary and tertiary damage to the victim, who you can only see the possibility of doing something worse than peropero? If you want to do that, you should pay Sushiro to let the kid eat the sushi with spit in front of you so that he can know if you don't like what he did to you. It's something I did, so I should be able to eat it with no problem, right?",1,1
"I read this article and I feel a puddle of tears. It is the victims who should be protected and the perpetrators deserve to pay for their crimes as they deserve. If you regret it, just don't do it. It is the parents' responsibility to raise a child who does not think bad things are bad, and to raise such a child. The family has to spend the rest of their lives making amends.",1,1
The reason for this strange advocacy is that postwar education was wrong. The tendency to view the human rights of perpetrators as unjustifiably high is probably based on the theory that evil people are also human. There is no consideration for those who have been harmed by the perpetrators. We should lead our lives keeping in mind retribution and self-inflicted suffering.,1,1
"Well, it's weird, isn't it? On the Internet, there are clearly more voices criticizing the perpetrators, but when it comes to the TV media and commentators, many of them seem to be gentle when defending or criticizing the perpetrators. They say, ""The assailant is at fault. The perpetrators are to blame, and they should be compensated less. I have never seen them criticize the perpetrators. I think it's partly because they are expressing their opinions in public, so it's hard for them to make comments for the sake of later criticism and image, but I wonder why so many of them say ""the perpetrator will be rehabilitated in the future"".",5,1
"That's cheap, no matter what you think. I thought it was very kind of you. I felt that criminal-friendly Japan is also here. I don't understand the point of defending them. I wonder why they would want to defend someone who committed such a stupid act when so many innocent people were inconvenienced and the company must have suffered tremendous damage.",1,1
"It is true that the restaurant was damaged. It is better to sue them. However, I am not convinced that the friends who posted the information on social media, the influencers who spread the information, and the media who further spread the information are not to blame. Since there will be no more dumb children, I think this kind of damage will not disappear unless those who spread the news are controlled. Of course, this is not a Sushiro problem, but a legal problem.",1,2
"To be clear, our country is too lenient to the perpetrators of crimes. The fact that they publish their acts on YouTube is beyond the level of a prank. But still, it is too cheap. They should be given a price that they can't pay even if it takes them the rest of their lives. He deserves what he gets, so I don't care if he can pay or not.",2,1
"Before the price is low or high, these idiots and their parents are too often unwilling or unable to pay the money in the first place. There may be cases in which unscrupulous attorneys are getting wise, but it is still better to ignore them and not pay them anyway. The rules and laws should be revised to make sure that they always pay up, for example, prohibiting the transfer of assets for a certain period of time or making it a prerequisite for seizure.",5,1
"Are you a door person, the creator of this article? Have you forgotten what happened to Germany after WWI when they received huge reparations claims? Or have you never taken a history lesson? Have you been that stupid that you haven't seen Ooka Koshizen? Japan is generally a country of naniwabushi.　It would be unacceptable if we do not compensate for the damage to some extent, but depending on the boy's remorse, we need to take a more mature and acceptable approach to the Japanese people.",1,2
"This is probably a case where what was intended to be a prank turned into a big problem. I don't know how it was in this family, but I suspect it is a chain of events where parents don't teach, don't pay attention, and even if they do pay attention, the children rebel and don't listen. Even if others around them notice and warn them, they are likely to be offended and do not want to get involved, and even more so if the group of children and young people are thug-like. (Some of them are connected to anti-social figures.) This is because leftist organizations and people tend to follow the opposite side of the crowd. If this happens, your life and career will not go well for a while. Maybe you should go to a religious college, train in a temple or church, and become a clergyman. You failed, but you will be respectable in 10 years.",1,1
"It's not like they killed anyone, and they've been socially sanctioned, so I guess we should cut them some slack.",1,1
Why do we care about the perpetrator's future when he did not think about the victim's future and did what he wanted and caused damage? Because he is a minor? Then the parents should be punished together to serve as a deterrent for him.,2,1
"Rehabilitation of juvenile offenders? If the government and the legislature are going to make sense, then the parents who educated them should be held accountable, and it's also important to exempt them from filing for bankruptcy so they can't get away with it. All Japanese laws are lenient on the perpetrators and harsh on the victims, and this should all be corrected by throwing out past precedents.",1,1
"Most of you guys are mistaken. In America, companies don't sue for this kind of thing. In the U.S., companies would not sue for this kind of thing because they would be seen as ""bullying the weak"" companies that would sue for something like this.

The comments here really show the national character. ""We will thoroughly attack anyone who disturbs the order. This was true at Corona as well. It's the same with baby strollers, isn't it?",1,3

Even if they are minors. I am sure that all Japanese people who are intelligent, well educated, and above all, morally sound, would agree with me.

">This is not what people who are supposed to be ""liberals,"" including in so-called politics, are supposed to be ""saying nice things. The idea that if you are a liberal and you do something wrong, you should be punished accordingly is the same. Liberal or not? No? It doesn't matter, it's an individual person's opinion. Don't lump them all together! I would say, ""Don't lump them all together! Now, about the amount of money, it is a low amount, and it will probably be further reduced after the trial, but I think it is better to charge an amount that can possibly be paid and to continue paying it even after the perpetrator, not the parents, become adults, rather than charging an undesirable amount and having the perpetrator go bankrupt easily. Wouldn't it be a better deterrent to increase the number of cases where the perpetrators themselves, not their parents, have to pay for the rest of their lives? However, it is very difficult to make people who do stupid things like this aware of the cases.",1,1
"That's right. If the person slurps on the soy sauce bottle, the actual damage is limited to disinfecting and replacing the bottle. The problem is that each person who 1) licks the soy sauce cup, 2) takes a picture of it, 3) uploads it on SNS, and 4) spreads the uploaded picture on SNS (including the media) is responsible for the damage. 67 million yen is too much if you only take 1. 2 is the same kind. The biggest problem is the person who did 3, and as a result, 4 is causing the most damage. Is that right, judicially speaking? The analogy may be different, but if someone was raped and 1. raped by A, B, 2. filmed it, C, 3. posted it on a social networking site, D, 4. reported A by his real name, E (in this case B is equivalent to Sushiro), in this case E had to report it so that B would not know who he is. In other words, he should not have reported it by mentioning the name Sushiro. Otherwise, they would have been equally guilty.",1,3

I don't go to sushi restaurants or beef bowl chains. If you want to defend yourself, you need to eat with the utensils that were used to get sushi pelted. This is an incident that demands that you be prepared for it.",2,1
"Personally, I think the perpetrators of this incident are of course those people, but secondarily, it is the people who spread the video, the media who wrote articles about it for fun, the customers who demand that companies take all kinds of measures, and the commentators and Yahoo! In a way, it was these people who started the seed fire, but many others are saying, ""I am not the culprit (seed fire),"" and even if they all send the wind, the fire will spread and become a forest fire. Then, they put all the responsibility on the guy who set the seed fire, and they are watching with joy as he breaks down in tears with a huge debt, saying ""Suck it up.",1,1
"The sexual goodness theory that infests Japanese society. The sweet dream of rehabilitation. The self-proclaimed good sense that tries to overlook evil. These dimwits are leading Japanese society in the wrong direction. Yamamoto's lack of decency as a member of the Diet was also brought about by the Japanese society that defends the perpetrators. The same goes for excuses such as ""I was drunk and don't remember. The same goes for excuses such as ""I was drunk and don't remember. If he was drunk to the point of losing his memory, he is guilty of dangerous drinking and should not be given a heavier sentence, but rather, the social mindset of defending the perpetrator should be changed to ""If he was drunk, it can't be helped. The excuses that are paraded around are ""I didn't mean to kill him,"" ""He was too drunk to remember,"" and ""I didn't mean to injure him. The severity of the crime and responsibility should be judged based on the results of the crime, but instead, the emphasis is placed solely on extenuating circumstances, such as ""culpability"" and ""upbringing. By defending the perpetrators, the victims are left behind, and similar crimes will only increase. Sushiro is not the only victim in this case.

"I don't think the plan to rehabilitate Peropero boy by working as a servant in a restaurant is a good idea. After all, he is a boy who has committed unhygienic acts, and it would be difficult for him to gain credibility because he could get caught in the devil's trap in the absence of human attention. The purpose of corrective labor is too different from corrective labor because other restaurants hire based on work ethic and the person's personality.",1,1

"The parents say that it is our fault, but the worst offender is the person who has caused the nuisance. If we keep defending our children, we may miss the timing for them to become independent and self-sufficient.",1,1
"I think Japan is a country that protects the perpetrators and exposes the victims. Why do we keep the names of the perpetrators secret and expose the victims to personal concessions? I hope that the risk of mischief, even with these damages, will be strictly disposed of so that the idiots in the world can see what kind of a risk they are taking.",2,1
"We've been sloppily compensating people, which is why people like this are roaming the streets. Traffic violations are close to home. How much has it decreased since the parking ban was tightened? There is no law for agitators, and the application of the law for drunkenness is unclear, so there is still no decrease in the number of such people. The number of people who take pictures of trains is only increasing because they think that if the police ask them about the situation, they will just be sent to the police station and JR will remain silent and apologize and that will be the end of it. Thanks to supermarkets and convenience stores, shoplifters are free to shoplift again after half a day. Incidentally, there are two convenience stores in my town that have been closed due to shoplifting. They were crying that the head office ordered them not to file a damage report and the police immediately let them go. There is no rehabilitation. Sex offenders are poisoning women and children at every turn thanks to lax laws. I had an old man in my neighborhood who raped an elementary school kid within hours of getting out of the police station. I would like to keep him in jail for 5 or 6 years.",2,2
"Japan is a paradise for criminals - everything is based on the principle of goodness, but times have changed in the 21st century, the age of adulthood has been lowered, and the rehabilitation of juveniles? If you have committed a crime, I hope you will be punished justly and work to rehabilitate yourself by setting your nails on fire.",2,1
"Unfortunately, the Japanese are a people who have never been involved in human rights or democracy from the beginning, but after the defeat in the war, they were forcibly taught human rights and democracy by Western countries, and because they are not a democracy that actively thought and adopted them, they mistakenly believe that extreme protection of human rights is the right thing to do, and extremely protect perpetrators rather than victims. Japanese people who think that this is the right way to protect human rights are not very smart, because they do not make any effort to cope with the fact that China is overtaking them in technology and economy.",1,1
"I am also amazed at the stupidity of netizens who find amusement in annoying videos in the restaurant industry, showcase lounging videos of part-time workers at convenience stores, and morally deficient acts. The nuisance photographers who caused the emergency stop of the Cassiopeia should also be charged a large amount of compensation. There is no end to the dangerous and annoying behavior of those who ignore the station staff's physical restraints and announcements on the station platforms. The railroad companies should demand hefty bills from these people as well. Japan's judiciary is based on the sexual goodness by good people, and it is not able to cope with today's explosive increase in the number of fools without a shred of morals or shame. This is spurred on by the human rights groups, liberal media, celebrities, and other misguided people who are all too happy to say what is pleasing to their ears.",3,1
"More than 60 million in damages for a mere licking of a soy sauce container and a teacup! He's only a little over 20 years old and it was a youthful indiscretion. Isn't that the interpretation? That's naive. There may be similar cases in all stores because of this. Moreover, it had a huge impact on the company's stock price and sales. That's why.",1,1
"This is a very emotional and incendiary article. I don't see anyone defending him. The main problem is that the amount of responsibility for what he did has been multiplied thousands of times by the spread. Originally, if I had seen him do that, I should have just reported it to the store in secret. Then the damage could have been minimized. However, someone dared to spread the news as if they were trying to start a fire, and the mass media also encouraged the media to spread the news, so that almost all Japanese people knew about it. The disadvantage caused by their spread is immeasurable. There is a term to ridicule ""righteous men,"" but I think this kind of righteousness run amok is becoming the most harmful thing of all. Also, Sushiro had a bad image because of their repeated fraudulent advertisements right up until this incident. I don't think they should be taking advantage of the public's opinion to beat the kids. You say that in other countries, but Japan is the only country that is this fastidious. In France, when you buy a baguette, it is handed to you without a bag and you take it home on the dashboard of your car.",2,3
"I am not defending Mr. Peropero-kun at all, and I think he deserves little compensation, but what I would like to say is, ""Why only Mr. Peropero-kun?"" The only thing I would like to say is ""Why only Mr. Peropero-kun?"" There are countless other people who have committed the same kind of annoying behavior, but the adult situation seems to have lured ""weak-looking Mr. Peropero-kun"" into the situation.  I could have predicted this, 'Peek', but Sushiro has been more evil than I expected, and has taken away Mr. Peropero-kun's life, and has tolerated other annoying acts.",1,2

"Which other countries are you referring to? The point is abstract. By the way, it seems that if you are in the US, the trend is that it's the store's fault. And the cause and effect of the damage is unclear. Is it Peropero-kun's fault that the stock price has dropped and sales have fallen? Before the Peropero-kun incident, Sushiro had many scandals including decoy advertisements. Prices were raised and sushi became smaller. Incidentally, after the incident, Sushiro's stock price rose after the incident, probably due to his advocacy. What Mr. Peropero-kun did and what he posted on social networking sites are not good things, but in our country, which is ruled by law, I think it is strange to claim damages for which no causal relationship can be recognized based on emotional arguments. Unless you want to be like some neighboring country.",1,4
"Well, even if you kill a few people, the media will say something about the human rights of the perpetrators, about their rehabilitation, and in the worst case, they will say that the perpetrators are pathetic. I wonder what it is. Is it postwar education, or is it leftovers from the Zenkyoto generation? I don't think Japanese people have always been like this. They were dragged around the city and thrown in jail, or beheaded if they stole 10 ryo. Or a hundred strikes for the slightest offense. And returning to the island is tattooed on the body. It's not the court's fault either. They say there is room for rehabilitation, and they give out a lot of suspended sentences. Even if you run over a person and kill him by running through a red light, you can get a suspended sentence. It's a scary world for honest, good people.",2,1
"Really, Japan cares about the rehabilitation of the perpetrator before making amends, which is crazy. It is the victim first. And this amount of money is too low. Furthermore, the judge will probably give a lower sentence than this amount. Japan's judiciary is a country that is abnormal in the sense that it is always in favor of the offenders, not the victims.",4,1
"Of course the Sushipero boy is to blame. But do you realize that people who write on the Internet that ""he should charge more"" and ""he deserves to be blamed"" are no different from Internet stalkers who hurl abusive comments at vulnerable people on the Internet?　It's the same as the idea that ""I'm apologizing, so I admit fault, so it's okay to beat me up.　This author says, ""You can charge more,"" but are you uneducated?　I'm pretty sure that 6 million yen is not admissible, let alone 67 million yen. What is wrong with Sushiro that he knows that and charges for it? To begin with, even before Sushipero, this company has been plagued with disguise issues and various other management problems. The company has a lot of work to do before focusing on Sushipero, but it has done a good job of dodging criticism. I wonder if they have forgotten how many people were slamming Sushiro before Sushipero.",1,1
"The people who did this are at least old enough to make a sane decision. They need to be sanctioned socially and financially to ensure that they will never be forgiven. Rehabilitation is a matter of after they have atoned for their crimes. You are just showing your lack of thinking by trying to act like an intellectual who understands. You think washing dishes and cleaning are easy jobs that anyone at the bottom can do, that's exactly what you think at the bottom.",1,1
"Considering the cost and time and effort required to rehabilitate him, it would be quicker to dispose of him as a poor prognosticator, but I think he should be made to pay for his crime and face up to what he has done.",1,1
"There really is a lot of logic in this country that is convenient for the perpetrators. They say, ""I didn't have bad intentions,"" ""I didn't think it would become such a big deal,"" ""I was drunk and don't remember much,"" ""It was a child's act, so let's tolerate it,"" ""The perpetrator has a future, too. And being drunk is no excuse. Even if the victim is a child, it is not something that should be said before the victim's forgiveness has been granted, at least not until after the victim's parents have fully compensated him or her for the damage he or she has caused, if he or she is not able to do so. And, of course, high school students should not be unaware of how many precedents there are and how much fuss has been made over this incident. It is not a case of breaking a glass while playing baseball. Whether they have the ability to pay or not, they should be held accountable and punished as they should be.",3,1
"It's not a good way to ruin a boy's life. He may not be able to pay back the money and may go on to commit other crimes, and parents will not want to have children, leading to further declines in fertility.",1,4
"If a child accidentally licks a store fixture, they might charge you 60 million yen. A waiter who looks like a beauty bureau might make a false accusation against a customer. You can't even go out to eat. I might as well sell my shares in the restaurant chain. If you go out to eat for the small profit of the special benefit and get into trouble, your life is over.",1,2
"I heard that in the U.S., even if a juvenile sets fire to a mountain and causes a huge fire, he is acquitted because he is a juvenile. That is why boys keep committing the same crimes. Japan is more sane. That is not the reason for the low crime rate in Japan.",1,1
"The TV and news media are just a bunch of onlookers who don't give a damn about the victims, and can't understand the pain of the victims, as you can see from the state of the entertainment industry and the news reports. That's why the punishment for criminal and anti-social behavior in the industry is so lenient.",2,1
"Because I am a minor. And it's not a done deal. I think we should review the cases of minors in this case, murder cases, assault cases, and all the rest. I think we should also punish those who protect the guilty.",2,1
"＞In a country where such acts have been dismissed as ""pranks,"" the amount is on the large side. Japanese society is soft on students. As is the case with these incidents, so-called ""bullying"" in schools is a crime that falls under the category of ""assault,"" ""theft,"" etc., and the school staff who overlook such crimes are criminals who are guilty of concealing the culprit and aiding and abetting the crime.",2,1
"The law should be revised before the verdict in order to make this country a ""decent"" place where ""honesty makes fools of people."" The government should be responsible for the full amount of compensation even if it takes the victim the rest of his/her life.　　The victimized party suffers the same damage whether the other party is an adult or a minor. If he/she does not harm others, there is no need to worry about the future. In the first place, are victims and society really seeking ""rehabilitation of the offender""? All they want is ""restoration of damage"" and ""punishment,"" and ""don't get involved again. To be honest, they really don't even want ""remorse. Only those who are close to the person in question want ""rehabilitation"" or ""remorse. They are old enough to know what they are not supposed to do. The result of ""pranks"" and ""mischief"" should be ""an example"" that ""ruins your life and the price will follow you until you die.",1,2
"I'm sure many people felt more sympathy for the parents than they did for the boy. Parents with children of the same age would not be a stranger to the situation. If the family were to have a family suicide, it would have a bad aftertaste, so I think the wide news shows would cover for them.",2,2
"I mean, what is the management responsibility of the restaurant industry, which has zero food control? Some of the points were made by the peropero boy. He is playing the victim, but did you take security measures to ensure that anyone could spit or put garbage in the food anytime they wanted to? The social networking sites have only made the traditional problems visible. Then the restaurant industry is not a victim, but has been totally disregarding food safety.",1,1
"I have no intention of defending the Peropero boy, but in reality, isn't it too much to ask for 67 million yen? If he had been doing it habitually, it is too large an amount to charge him just for this one video, and since he is a minor, he is not fully responsible for his actions.",2,3
"Even if they claim compensation, they won't be able to pay even a tenth of what they're owed anyway, so the judgment amount could be 10 or 100 billion. In any case, the company is losing money because of the extra expenses. Even minors can tell the difference between right and wrong, and those who are generally junior high school students or older need to be punished together with their parents.",1,1
"Including amounts other than direct losses, that's several hundred million yen, right? You should be thankful. It's a good opportunity to tell people what will happen if they do such a thing in public. I don't mean the whole family. At least the parents and siblings should pay.",1,1
"Frequent young people (idiots), convinced that they want to be nice on social networking sites, are doing it, even though the news has reported many times that they will pay for the damage. It is not surprising that elderly people are getting infected by the condiments and sushi that the young boys have been nabbing in the dangerous situation under the corona. Sushiro and the food service industry are still suffering tremendous damage. The amount of the lawsuit is 67 million yen as Sushiro. I would like you to explain the reality of what will happen if parents and educational institutions do something stupid like this. Anyway, crimes committed by teenagers and 20-somethings nowadays are easy money-grabbing, black job robbery, murder with disabilities, and social networking to show off. 。。。。 I hope they will think carefully about their actions so that they will not have any regrets in their long life.",1,1
"This is more than just a mild prank. A store that was not at fault was attacked in a manner comparable to a terrorist attack. A private store could have gone out of business. A leniency because of the size of the company, its capital and profits? Because he is a juvenile? Because he has a future? What are you talking about? Even though the damages have been lowered to the extent that they can be paid with a huge reduction? There is still a certain segment of people who are on a mission to defend the perpetrators and attack the victims. It's over.",1,1
"I can't defend what the perpetrator did, but he probably has a severe developmental or personality disorder. As for the future, I think support is a must. Of course, I can't escape the responsibility of compensation.",2,2
"Sushiro's losses are said to be 16 billion. According to some observers, that may be true. But it is not an amount that a family of a young boy, who is just a commoner, would be able to come up with no matter how hard they try. In fact, it is a foolish measure that could drive the family to the brink of extinction. I wonder if he will be kept alive as a ""yakashi sensai"" (a man who makes a fool of himself).",1,1
"The future of the perpetrator? There is no need to think about that. The top priority is to recover from the damage. In general, Japan is too lenient to perpetrators. Especially juvenile crime. The majority of people do not commit crimes, so why protect them when the criminals are wrong? People who make such statements should be responsible for their actions. It is irrelevant to the victims.",3,2
"Do the media realize that this is the result of their pampering of minors in this way? If you want to play the role of an understanding adult, you should collect 67 million yen and pay it on behalf of the boy. Maybe the boy will be grateful, feel indebted, and reform himself. If that doesn't happen, then you will know that your idea of an understanding and kind adult is completely useless for the rehabilitation of the boy. Liberals are completely useless in these matters.",1,1
"Japan needs to be made an example of, not some annoying youtuber, but a regular guy who does something wrong. If only this had been done, the illegal activities on the net that have continued since the Winny incident would have been a bit more subdued.",1,2
"If they want to defend the perpetrators so badly, they should shoulder the compensation and then have all the costs of rehabilitation. We don't need a liberal media that will just talk without giving any money or effort! Considering the hardships and damages to the victims, it would be in the media's power to work to restore the victims' trust.",2,1
"You are absolutely and completely right. I would like to see a credentialing process for the media and self-proclaimed intellectuals who pretend to be liberals. I think they want to think they are smart by doing the opposite of what the dumb public says. Since malicious abuse of power does not occur in the current Japanese judiciary, they want their existence value to be recognized by calling out something different from the common sense in such cases, but that is the same mindset as the lawyers in charge of the conscription trial in the neighboring country. They continue to act insane in order to stand out. Is such a media necessary?",1,1
"The court amounts for damages in Japan are unusually low. While there is the death penalty, the punishment for damages is very easy. This gentleness is truly abnormal. We must correct this anomaly to avoid doing something stupid.",1,1
"To be honest, apart from lawsuits, anyone who takes a video and exposes themselves is just a moron. I'm sure there are a lot of people who don't take videos and do dirty things. They lick a toothpick and put it back, or spit on their hands before looking at the menu list. They put snot in common things. There are definitely people who do things like that and gloat about it. If this were to come to light, it would be considered obstruction of business. I see people who don't wash their hands after going to the restroom all the time. I guess they don't know, but it's disgusting.",2,1
"It is too naive to believe that the damage is not even 1/100th of the damage caused. North Korea, for example, is a terrible country where people's lives are treated like pieces of paper by a dictator. This country, on the other hand, values human rights and life so much that it has become a corrupt country where the victims are not considered and the criminals are not punished much. In the sense of being corrupt, it is much the same as a dictatorship.",3,3
"You don't mention the point that if the media had just let it go through.... What would this do if a small child was perusing and someone who saw it posted it and it became famous? Would the person who posted it be compensated?　Or the parents of the child who peroperoed it? I won't go to Sushiro anymore, and I want them to do something about it!"" are the same and the damage is the same. Negligence and waza are different in maliciousness...but the damage would be the same. Whether you drive your car into a store negligently or intentionally, the damage is the same. It's malicious! It's not right to say ""because it's malicious"" or ""because he's old. I think it would be less damaging if they did it on purpose in a joint effort than if they did it as a casual, everyday prank or as a prank by a shopkeeper. I think the damage was made worse by the noise of the onlookers. Geez! What a mess! That kid (about 4 years old)..."" has been a common occurrence for a long time. This time it's different from that because they were sure... but 100 million yen compensation is not reasonable.",1,1
"Compared to the impact it caused, I think this amount of money is cheap. Even though he is a minor, he is probably old enough to judge the right and wrong of things. If someone is defending him, why don't they send a little bit of compensation to the perpetrator? You may defend them in your comments, but you don't move as a formality, do you?",3,1
"Defending the perpetrators means the Japanese people. There are those who slander the victim in the opposite direction, even in the case of sexual assault. TV stations put mosaics on the faces of the current offenders on security cameras. A country where strange human rights are practiced. However, I feel uncomfortable with the huge compensation in the U.S. that the perpetrators cannot pay. If they can't pay, the victims end up crying themselves to sleep.",1,1
"'Balancing the major media' is laughable. Chef and the Johnny's office are clearly confirmed criminals, making it difficult for them to appear on TV just because of the adultery scandal. And yet, TV stations and sponsors still have contracts with the Johnny's office and the talent continues to appear on TV. There is no balance, but rather a lot of discovery. The corrupt TV stations, sponsors, and media have not pointed this out, and nothing has changed since the incident. The TV stations and TV programs that allow non-expert celebrities to express their opinions should take responsibility for their comments.",1,1
"I don't think they are suing just for the Peropero boys, but to eliminate similar practices in the food and beverage industry in the future. So I am all for suing.",5,1
"It is unthinkable that a person of a certain age would do the same thing just for laughs in a video, even though it has been on the news many times and is known to be a nuisance. Even if these idiots show remorse on the surface, there is a possibility that they will repeat the same behavior again and again, so they really need to be made to suffer. I don't know what kind of people would protect the perpetrators without caring about the damage to the store, where they are working so hard.",1,1
"Minkabu articles are decent and good. The others are terrible. I don't care about the rehabilitation of the boy. The interests of Sushiro's stakeholders must come first. That should be the same for the media, but all they do is report things that are a drag on society. Sushiro's lawsuit, by demanding punitive damages from the brat, will help curb similar behavior in the future and lead to social stability. It will also contribute to Sushiro's performance and benefit many stakeholders. The media's coverage of juvenile rehabilitation is limited to generating PV with high-profile headlines and contributing little to the company's own performance. However, it is an antisocial article that encourages juvenile crime and destabilizes society. Incidentally, a company as big as Sushiro also has a shareholding in the pension fund, which has a small impact on the amount of pensions that almost all Japanese citizens will receive in the future. In terms of the impact on other stakeholders, the largest stakeholder is the major shareholder. Employees are the most affected. Bonuses will also be affected.",1,1
"Still, there are those who defend the Peropero boy, and it is the TV and mass media that emphasize and report this. Rehabilitation? Rehabilitation? Rehabilitation? Even elementary school students know what they should not do, and they have been told to stop it for years...but they don't stop. I'm not talking about rehabilitation. The same rooted defenders of the perpetrators are those who are obstructing the amendment of the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act. Illegal immigrants and illegal workers are deported by law, but the moment these illegal immigrants are arrested, they turn around and say they are refugees who will be persecuted if they return home. Moreover, they are not only illegal aliens, but also have criminal records...they are refugees. This is where the activists who are clamoring for foreigner's rights and discrimination come in. Oppose the revision of the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act! What a bunch of crap. And this is also what the TV mass media..........................................reports, defending these law-breaking foreigners by treating them as refugees. It's the same root...the business of defending the human rights of the perpetrators.",2,1
"Those who defend the perpetrators are hypocrites. I don't think it's a noble idea. The case has cast a shadow over the lives of the victim companies, the families of the company employees, and the part-time employees, and I wish the people who are defending the criminals, even if they are juveniles, would do something about their extreme thinking.",2,1
"Do we really need to think about the future of criminals? I'm sure my daughter is still in kindergarten, but she knows the difference between right and wrong.",2,2
"67 million yen is cheap. The victim's family and relatives should be included, and the money should be taken from where it can be taken. The rest should be socially sanctioned. Otherwise, this kind of thing will never disappear. Also, if left unchecked, Japan will be seen as a prank heaven, and foreign youtubers will come to misbehave!",1,2
"They say that they are thinking about the future of the peropero boys, but if we allow this to happen easily, new peropero boys will come out one after another. If we forgive the culprits each time, we will lose control of the situation. If we can just say, ""I'm sorry,"" then there would be no need for the police.",2,1
"How much is it actually in other countries? Some people commented that it would be in the hundreds of millions in the U.S., but if there is a case in South Dakota where a high school student who put his finger in the hole of a Dunkin' Donuts donut and spun it around was awarded $1 million in damages, then, yes, that's true, but there's no commenter, and there is no author who is so proud to say ""In the U.S...."". But there is no such thing in the U.S., and there is no such thing in the U.S.",1,1
"Since the old days, the victims of a case are probed to the root and never get the word out about the culprit. It is not only this case. This is the basic attitude of Japanese trash. They should be destroyed, including the punishment for the parents who raised the culprit to be a low quality human being. They must have raised their children without any sense of tension.",1,1
"Is it a liberal who is protecting him? Is Kazushige Nagashima a liberal? If anything, I think Toru Tamagawa is a liberal, but here's what he saidーーIn response to the lawsuit, commentator Toru Tamagawa of the same station explained, ""Under the criminal law, there is a point where we can't charge him with that much crime because he is a minor, so it is under the civil law. He then pointed out, ""I think Sushiro is filing the lawsuit to let society know that if they do something like this, they bear this much responsibility.　He continued, ""If they end up saying, 'We'll forgive him because he is a juvenile,' then there will be no point in bringing the case to court at all. So, in reality, there are cases where a child runs away saying that he/she cannot pay. In reality, however, it is necessary to do exactly what is necessary, including garnishment of wages. He also commented, ""In reality, there are cases where children run away because they can't pay.",1,1
There is not a millimeter of sympathy for the perpetrators...they deserve a much higher compensation bill...they have caused that much damage...we should abolish the age requirement and establish a law to severely punish felonies as soon as possible.

On the contrary, there is no country that is so cold to victims. Even in the case of bank transfer fraud, the crime is so lenient. Fraud should be punishable by life in prison.",1,1
"I totally agree with you. Only lawyers should defend the perpetrators. This laxity in Japan is increasing the number of crimes committed by minors. What is bad is bad. Furthermore, washing dishes,.... It is very disrespectful to those who work hard. I hope they will be severely punished.",1,1
"The mass media is liberal? If you really believe that, please go to a psychiatrist. Mass media is commercialism, right? They do not tell the public what is fair, but only think about how they can make profits for their own companies.

If the boy, who has lived a serious life, has caused damage through some fault, that's a different story! Must the world be tolerant of such a nasty person?",1,1
I wonder if it is a good idea to equate Japan with immigrant countries. I don't think a huge compensation claim is appropriate since they did not commit heinous crimes such as robbery or murder. Wouldn't this be counterproductive to the company's image?,2,1
"As per this article. Protection and advocacy of victims comes first. A perpetrator is only a perpetrator. The rehabilitation of the perpetrator should be considered first by the perpetrator and those around him, and it would be outrageous to make the victim do it. Would you let a victim rehabilitate a rapist? Would you let an old geezer run over a mother and her child and force the victim's family to rehabilitate him?",1,1
"Some people say that uploading to social networking sites is a problem, but it is wrong to do this in the first place. They say, ""What if I don't upload the photos? That is not true. This happened because the parents were not disciplined enough. All they had to do was to discipline their children well.",2,1
"It is said that a person can earn 100 million (depending on circumstances and times) in their lifetime, so if this bonafide family is a regular salaried worker, they are ruined. A husband and wife working together could pay twice this amount, and I personally think they should pay the full amount of the company's loss. Well, I'm a parent with kids like this, so I don't have a good income. Maybe I'm biased, but what they're doing ain't a wealthy family.",3,1
"I think that because Japanese people have been told to save money since childhood, many adults have a tendency to save money, and judges, without exception, are judges who have a tendency to save money and use discretion. Judges who are frugality-oriented turn on their frugality switch every time they issue a compensation payment order, and the amount of compensation is so large that the victim cries a lot, doesn't it? In the U.S., the court will order the payment of billions of dollars if the case is worth several hundred million dollars, and in the U.S., the court will order the payment of billions of dollars if the case is worth several hundred million dollars. The fact that there are many cases in which the defendant who committed a crime other than a felony is given a light sentence that is not commensurate with the crime means that the public has doubts about the court.",1,1
"Japan should not do it rather than crying about it later, but it is important to take all the money you can get so that there will be no more similar idiots in the future.",1,1
"Japanese criminal law is really lenient. It only protects the human rights of the perpetrators. If a police officer opens fire on a robber, the news title will be ""police officer opens fire"" first. This is a uniformed ethnic group, so it has been done, but as more and more foreigners reside in Japan, the deterrent effect is likely to become less and less effective. In Japan, it's OK to kill one person and not get shot.""",1,1
"Japanese animation also represents the sentiments of the Japanese people. Sympathy for the bad guys. Baikinman, Doronjo, and the bad guys are skipped over and done with. We don't crush them thoroughly. It may be a Buddhist way of thinking, but there has been such a way of thinking for a long time.",1,1
"The social networking companies such as Twitter are just as bad. They don't take any countermeasures, so even if they do something wrong and get caught, it's like they are successful as long as their name sells. The fact that they are underage and young is not a reason to defend them. People who don't do anything wrong don't do anything wrong from the beginning.",3,1
"I guess acquitting a perpetrator who is easily beaten and easily convicted is a great tickler of merit for lawyers and others in the law. They must know that they are indispensable for their own career and that it is for their own good to protect this perpetrator who has done terrible things and reduce his sentence as much as possible. Trash is a group that always tries to profit by reporting unusual cases, whether peropero or not, regardless of the damage to the victim, because it cannot exist without the public's ears (ratings) being turned to itself. They are almost meaningless.",1,1
"I think it's fair to say. This idiot boy claims to be sorry, but I don't think he actually is. If he had the human nature to be sorry, he wouldn't have done such a stupid thing. He didn't do anything to be blamed for! Why do you blame yourself so much? That's about the extent of it. There is no way that such an idiot can be rehabilitated, and even if he does go out into the world, he probably won't be able to find a decent job, and will probably only be working part-time as an oleole scammer. He should be forced to work in a juvenile prison for the rest of his life!",1,2
"Even if I sold my house in Gifu Prefecture, 40 minutes by car from the nearest station, it would probably be about one-tenth of what I paid for it. Even if he sold his farm and his car, it would still be a far cry. I don't feel sorry for the parents who were taking pictures of their son's foolishness, but I do feel sorry for the boy's little brother, who has just been born. He has no money to go to high school.",3,1
"I guess it's good to make an example of them. That being said, there are many comments blaming the perpetrators, but if the boy or his family committed suicide or something, they would probably flip out.",1,1
"I think this article is spot on. The victim is not only suffering from the incident, but also the subsequent loss of not only meeting the budget (sales target), but also the number of customers will obviously decrease. I think the culprit needs to go to jail and pay for the damages (including the estimated budget the whole company can get and the amount spent on cleanup such as disinfection) or else the idiots will repeat themselves.",1,1
"It's just like this article says, Japan is very lenient to criminals. People like Kazushige may think they are saying good things, but why should the victim consider the situation of the offender? Would you feel sorry for them if they did the same thing to the company you run?",1,1
"It is more beneficial to the welfare of the juvenile to not make this juvenile No. 2 and No. 3 with one punishment and 100 commandments than to coddle this one juvenile. Those who want to rehabilitate him can support him on their own. It is only worthwhile if they are punished in full and then rehabilitated. Besides, just one juvenile can be more generous than dozens of such juveniles and rehabilitate them all (if there are actually people who are willing to make the effort to rehabilitate them, that is).",2,1
"The most laughable thing is that you think you can seriously rehabilitate a minor. If it were possible to gently and quickly correct the personality and character that has been built up over time, even if it is immature, it wouldn't be that way. Evil is evil. If you don't put a noose around it, it will do it again and again, and it will get worse.",3,2
"In fact, the settlement with the defendant has been reached and the contents of the settlement are undisclosed. For the Sushiro side, the fact that 67 million yen was claimed is important. I believe that they are aiming for a hundred penalties. They can't make a lousy claim considering the other party's ability to pay from the beginning in front of their employees. But the trash is indeed terrible. The shortsightedness of the perpetrator is out of question, but there have been plenty of assholes in the past who have self-destructed after spreading stupid videos, so there is no room to defend the perpetrator.",1,1
"Not guilty by reason of mental and physical exhaustion, no liability for compensation. Maybe this is what could happen if we go by the current judicial trend. Now, can we hold them liable for parental responsibility? What if they declare bankruptcy? What if they say, ""Doraemon? There are so many questions in the judiciary these days. Isn't it becoming a case of ""he who does it, wins?",3,1
"It's crazy to cover for the perpetrators. There are those who openly defend the perpetrators, but I think they should be beaten equally. It's only natural that they should be held accountable for what they have done.",2,1
"I'm not trying to be supportive at all, but those of us who are not involved with Sushiro are certainly not in a position to evacuate. Now would be a good time for you to make your You Tube debut. If he confesses nakedly why he did what he did, he could get a lot of views. We can't pay back the money by working a regular job, so we have to make a business out of it. You can't do anything about what you have done. Don't rely on your parents, earn your own money and pay them back.",1,1
"It is abnormal that the voices of human rights are becoming louder and louder only against the perpetrators. Let's leave it to the judiciary and visualize the cost of what they have done. I don't understand the point of having a ""petty man"" work in the backyard to rehabilitate the victims.",3,1
"In the U.S., punitive damages of 1 billion and 2 billion are the norm. If apologies were enough to be forgiven, there would be no need for laws. I am disgusted by the idiotic commentators and the media that play with the incomprehensible terminology of human rights. The liberal press is a leftist ideology that destroys real democracy.",1,1
"After all, liberal media people belong to the upper class, the people who don't eat sushi at Sushiro because they belong to the upper class. But for the average person, a cheap chain restaurant kaiten-zushi is a familiar sight, and if such a familiar meal is threatened by a stupid high school prank, then of course they'll bash it. The media, which slams such behavior as unpopular and narrow-minded, is saying such open-minded things because they are upper class people and don't eat kaiten-zushi.",2,1
"I really think so. I think it is too cheap. There is not a millimeter of defense. Recently, the trash is defending the perpetrator, even the murderer, isn't it? It is normal to think that ""If I put myself in their shoes, I would immediately understand,"" but this has been the case for a long time now.",1,2
"It's easy for the one to blame, but for the one being blamed (the perpetrator) it's the end of the world. If it were you, but if it were your child, what would you do? Can you say the same thing? My child did something stupid. It is 600 million compensation with different orders of magnitude! I can't pay it, and would you break up the family? He's easy on the gallery. For the parents of the perpetrator, the image of his smile is the devil.",1,2
"The fact that more and more people are defending the perpetrators shows that the Japanese people are becoming less and less civilized year by year. When these people raise their children, they grow up to be people like the victims.",2,1
"I think the people defending this high school student's actions are people with the same type of developmental disability. In short, people who ""might do it"" themselves because they don't have a normal sense of right and wrong. This type of people are the same as those who support Gershie.",2,2
"The bad guy is Peropero, but if we focus only on the strong vs. weak structure, some people will say they feel sorry for him. It would be hard to blame Sushiro too. Personally, I feel like I'm looking at someone who says, ""Don't shoot the bear! I feel like I'm looking at someone who's opinion is ""Don't shoot the bear!",1,2
"Conveyor-belt sushi is a business that sells at a discount while taking advantage of the good sense of the Japanese people. The risk of this kind of mischief is natural, and before the age of social networking, people were probably victimized without even realizing it. Companies that provide a lax environment in order to make money are partly to blame, so it is not right to impose harsh penalties only on the immature perpetrators. I'm sure those who are tamed by the system and who love private punishment on the Internet will be outraged.",1,3
"Japan is a perpetrator's paradise, a country that seeks to protect the human rights of the perpetrators no matter how much the victims suffer, while ignoring the victims' human rights, which should be saved.",2,1
"If it's not just a way to get attention, one step ahead of the flame wars that some celebrities are defending in the first place, then you're just trying to make yourself look good, and you can't see that you're essentially being selfish and self-important, like a cool adult character in an adult modoki yankee comic.",1,1
"It's being defended because no one has ever filed a civil suit in this type of case before, and because the first one was a minor, and it was a show-and-tell civil suit, and no one else will do it. Why not do them all?",1,1
"It is impossible and futile to ask the media to do the right thing. They are not interested in being blamed or being blamed, as long as their articles are a hit with the public, they are happy with the result. They are ruthless, extremely selfish, and have no common sense, nor do they consider the feelings of others. That is the true nature of the media. I am not saying that there are no decent people working in the media, but I think that decent people cannot stand working in the media industry.",1,1
"If the judiciary does not answer Sushiro's 67 million yen in damages with a full answer, there will be a second or third Peropero boy, or a Nyurunyu and Kanagawa Prefectural Governor. Please give severe penalties, even if it is only civil!",2,1
"In Japan, students who bully the weak, delinquents, and yankees are valued more than ordinary students. I know it is unusual, but that is Japan.",1,1
"This is really a case where the politicians need to recognize the problem and punish it criminally, and very severely at that. Even if you fight it out in civil court, you'll just end up paying an unrealistic amount of money in court every time. The Diet members who are so quick to bite on trivial topics but ignore this issue are really incompetent.",2,1
Why don't the people who are defending the victims put together a fund so that they can pay the 67 million yen? Those who are defending Sushiro went to the restaurant and had a meal there to help out even a little. Those who say that the boy's future is at stake can only say such things about other people's homes.,2,1
"I always think that the reason why the trash only defend the perpetrators is because they have many friends on that side. And most of all, such an amateur minor is being sued for 70 million in compensation. Shouldn't the people involved with Lavitt, who did the same thing in a program as a professional job, pay a billion dollars in compensation to the Korean fried chicken restaurant? Or is TBS blameless in that area because of their connections in their home country?",1,1
"Whether a youthful offender is rehabilitated or not should be his/her own problem and should have nothing to do with the severity of the crime committed or the punishment. The most important thing to be protected is the rights and interests of the victim, not the offender. Japan is a country that is soft on criminals. What a strange country.",2,2
"You are absolutely right! Ultimately, it is the person who did the wrong thing.　It is nice to have a humane nation, but I think we also need to make an example out of them so that there will be no copycats.",1,1

"It would be a real downfall if the true meaning is not conveyed by saying from the top, ""The netizens don't understand."" When a politician says that the true intention was not conveyed in his or her explanation, it is the media that is criticized for it. The media is playing with words to suit its own convenience. I can only say that it is still trash.",2,1
"By all accounts, it is the assailant boy who is at fault. There is no one to defend him in the normal view. That is why the calls for one punishment and 100 commandments tend to escalate. I think it is the role of the newspapers and intellectuals to put a certain stop to such things. Well, it is a minority opinion in Yahoo!",3,2
"Of course, Peropero boy is wrong, but that doesn't mean that the act of a third party identifying personal information and interviewing him is any different from that of a hitter. It is the law that judges the boy, not people.",1,2
"I don't think Sushiro has always placed much importance on court cases. In short, I think it is more of a warning that if they do something like this, they will not get away with it for free. They are only taking the case to court to prevent a second or third idiot from imitating them.",1,1
"Sushipero compensation is the norm. It is the fault of the child who does not know how to judge what is right and wrong to do. And the parents who raised such a child are to blame. Would you be able to forgive if your own relatives were victims of this...for example, if they had committed murder, would you be able to defend them? This time, it was thought that you would accept the claim for compensation, but you have no remorse for fighting the case in court.",1,1
"The biggest perpetrators are not this boy, but the social networking sites and the media that spread the information in an entertaining way. In short, aren't they the ones who are profiting from it? So, the SNS and the media are trying to hide their own guilt by defending the perpetrator boy.",2,1
"You have done something wrong, so you should make amends for what you have done and make a fresh start. The parents of the perpetrator should pay for the rest of his/her life. Japan will be an individualistic country from now on, so you should wipe away the retribution for your own actions.",2,2
"The victim does not need to think about the rehabilitation of the perpetrator! That's exactly right! And I wouldn't want to use dishes, cups, etc. washed by someone who slurps soy sauce, nor would I want to employ such a person.",4,1
"No perpetrator of bullying suicides is made to pay so much, and if anything, he is exonerated. Soy sauce is just an indirect kiss. Does the scope of the impact change the heat of the comment?",1,2
"That's what makes us Japanese - for better or worse, we are a compassionate people. They feel sorry for him because he is a boy...he still has a future...they look at the perpetrator of the crime without looking at the crime. If this were an old man, there would be no defense. I don't know how I feel about it... but I still don't think he's sorry for what he said about his competitors and such, and I think he should do it thoroughly to curb the nuisance YouTubers out there. But I don't think it will resonate with the nuisance YouTubers.",1,1
"Is it okay for the victim to be on the street because his company went bankrupt, but not for the juvenile perpetrator to be on the street because he lost his job? Why should a criminal need a future?",3,2
"The representative of liberal is the United States of America. In the United States, if you spill coffee at McDonald's, the compensation exceeds 300 million yen. Even in communist countries where the image of liberal is different, if you caused a problem at a restaurant during the Stalin era, you were executed.",1,1
"Personally, I have no intention of defending the perpetrators, nor do I want to pretend to be a liberal, but I am basically an ""innocent"" and ""judge and jury"" person, so I say, ""I am justified! I'm righteous, and so is everyone else! I'm not trying to be a liberal at all, but I'm basically an ""innocent"" and ""judge and jury"" person, so when all I hear is ""I'm righteous!",2,2
"The criminal penalty should be more severe, as well as civil. Since it is a crime of obstruction, this juvenile should go to a juvenile reformatory. Juvenile reformatory for peroperation. If he is an adult, he should be imprisoned or fined. Japan is a capitalist country. Let them choose between money or imprisonment. Japan is a forgiving nation. The West is a race that does not forgive. Kindness and forgiveness are different. The Japanese are a race that separates rooms, but not sins.",1,1
The sentence will be about a million. The courts are kind to criminals. The advocates in the article are probably a tiny minority. Liberals always jump up and down when it comes to court cases.,1,1
"When you look at the financial statements of the service industry, profit margins are surprisingly low, which is compensated for by thin margins, but when an innocent store falls prey to the approval-seeking monsters and penalties are imposed to ensure that it never happens again, there is no responsibility. And when the media says ""poor them,"" of course the monsters are going to get carried away, and who the hell do they think they are?",1,1
"The media and the legal profession in Japan have a tendency to expose the privacy of the victims, with the perpetrators having human rights and the victims having no say in the matter. Especially the liberal media has criminal tendencies.",2,1

"Recently there has been an increase in crimes that do not seem to be committed by minors. If we don't hold them accountable for their actions, they won't be able to grow up to be decent adults. And parents have a responsibility to protect them.",1,1
"＞In the current situation, ""liberals,"" including those in politics, who think they are saying ""good things,"" are finding themselves increasingly unsupported. The essence of liberalism here can be summed up in one word: irresponsibility. They blame their hatred on the ignorance of others and solve their own problems. That's why they hate us so much.",1,1
"The breakdown is as follows: 30,000 yen for the loss of customers who saw the act of slapping and kissing on the spot, 5 million yen for the loss of customers who saw the video after it was uploaded and deleted, and 5 million yen for the loss of customers who stopped coming after the media spread the story, and 500 million yen for the loss of customers who stopped coming after the media spread the story.",2,1

Well...I guess it will be reduced and settled in court...I hope they pay him properly...I guess he will be kept in captivity for the rest of his life...Hooray for the bakatterer...I don't know if they reported the end of the bakatterer who closed the soba restaurant...did they pay him the compensation... I️ wonder if he paid the compensation.,1,1
Those who advocate for them can raise money through crowdfunding to substantially mitigate the compensation and introduce them to jobs that will lead to their rehabilitation.,1,1
"I think it's reasonable, or at least inexpensive, since the child is old enough to understand right from wrong. I think all the parents who couldn't raise their children properly will have to regret it for the rest of their lives.",1,1
"It's hilarious to see grown adults going right and left. The little brat played a prank on me and I'm going to claim a huge amount of money for it. If they would have just ended it with a ""we gave him a hard time"", it would have ended with ""that's a mature response"" and nothing would have happened. If the customer is a customer, the store is fighting on the same level.",2,2
"This article is right on the money! I don't understand why these liberals try to protect the human rights of the perpetrators, and I don't understand why the mass media, to avoid criticism from these people, is so weak-minded in reporting the fact that the perpetrators are minors, as if they are touching something that is swollen, and even defending them. The perpetrators are far from being rehabilitated, and unless they are severely punished and socially sanctioned, they will never be truly rehabilitated!",1,1
I'd like to see some evidence of the social benefits that could be expected if people like Peroperoniki were to be rehabilitated.,1,1
Crime is something that does not need to be committed! We need to stop playing nice and deal with all crimes that cause human and economic damage with severe penalties.,1,1
"It's a big company, and it's someone else's business, so they can put up all kinds of pretty words(?). They are a big company, and they are just trying to make things look good for other people. If you think about it, hiring a high school student who set Kazushige's house on fire as a housekeeper and rehabilitating him at home is a crazy idea, isn't it?",1,1

"I'm not trying to defend the media and Mr. Peropero, but I don't think we should be able to see beyond the criticism to the intention of dying and paying for it, and using that as an excuse to relieve stress is not healthy either. It's too cheap! Paying more is like asking for a banquet of pussy.",1,1
"I'm not sure if I'm just being hypocritical and defending the child because I want to be seen as a good, tolerant person, or if I don't have the wisdom to do so, but I'm too stupid to feel sorry for the child.",1,2

"If they were in the US, they would have charged about 16 billion as it is. Sushiro is kind, isn't it? Rehabilitating idiots is none of Sushiro's business. Pay the compensation and do your best to rehabilitate yourself. People won't really understand until they see the pain.",1,2

If you want to talk nicely, you should take care of them.",1,1

When you lick a soy sauce bottle, the damage is only to the bottle. If it is posted on social networking sites, the damage is limited to that moment.

"That's because Japanese people love cleanliness. It is a country like heaven for criminals.

"These kids should just be thoroughly spurned by society. The amount of compensation should be at least 10 times this amount.

It would be foolish to take seriously the opinion of an ignorant commentator who has grown up under a parasol with a nanny and has never appreciated money since he was a child and has never known hard work.

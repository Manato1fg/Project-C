"I am a middle school teacher. I feel that there is a need to transition club activities to the local area. There are so many areas for improvement: the number of students is decreasing year by year and many schools are not able to form independent teams, teachers are overloaded with overtime and not paid for it, and relationships with student parents are deteriorating because they are assigned to club activities in which they have no expertise at all. However, there are many municipalities that do not have leaders in the community. I think we should secure instructors even if it means some burden on families.",1170,149
"I am the director of a large sports facility. Recently, a basketball tournament for high school students in the prefecture and a table tennis tournament for high school students in the city were held. The teachers in charge arrive early in the morning to prepare for the tournaments. The tournament ended smoothly and without trouble thanks to the advisors' appropriate management and control of the players. Watching this, the staff and I discussed the fact that it would not have gone so smoothly if it had been local leaders instead of the teachers. For now, the goal is to separate the club activities from the teachers, but I am convinced that if we do not proceed carefully, trouble will occur one after another. I am really impressed with the work of the advisory teachers. I think it is really important that many students are guaranteed opportunities to play sports, but I think that the administration and committee members should study the field more carefully so that they do not give up on the project based on a desk plan.",282,129
"I think we have come to a conclusion as to whether we should continue to choose the path of ""no more people becoming teachers"" or the path of ""separating club activities from schools"". The state of affairs in which so many long hours of work have been performed by teachers for free until now is abnormal. We should start over from a clean slate and rethink who will be responsible for cultural and athletic activities for children and how costs will be shared.",785,48
"I agree in the sense that it will reduce the burden on the teachers. I think that teachers who wish to continue teaching should be allowed to do so, but they should be paid well, including new community instructors. Relying on volunteerism with no pay or low pay is irresponsible, and I think it will create new problems. (Not only this issue, but anyway, Japan should increase its budget for child-related activities much more.) I suppose there could be a form of transition to a comprehensive regional sports club like in Europe, but I think it would be difficult to do so immediately, so I think it would be better if the national government makes a plan and the transition is made in stages.",113,7
"Myself, I was a part of the school club activities. As for my children, they were heavily involved in local clubs, but they also participated in school club activities. This was because the school did not have the club activities that my children wanted to do. In the area where I live, there were 7-8 classes per grade when my child was in junior high school, but now I hear that there are only 4 classes per grade. I do not know the details, but I think that the number of club activities is also decreasing. I feel that the time has come to separate extracurricular activities from school in order for each student to engage in what he or she likes to do. However, this requires proper budgetary treatment. We think it may be time to switch to paid community clubs instead of free school club activities.",672,83
"I feel that only elementary and junior high schools are being promoted after the regional club activities. I would like to see high school club activities promoted more quickly as well. Club activities are voluntary activities of students, and there are teachers in the same workplace who want to provide guidance and teachers who do not want to provide guidance. Teachers who don't want to lead club activities sacrifice their families on weekends to lead club activities and organize games. Is this a terrible thing? At the end of the school year, the administration asks for advisor preferences. I would like you to listen to the opinions of those who do not want to be advisors. I would like you to give them to the national government or the Board of Education.",622,67
"I agree with the transition to the community. I would like to see lifelong sports, lifelong music, etc. promoted like club activities for all community residents, including adults, rather than separating them by age groups of elementary, middle, and high school. If there is a place where people of all ages, including children after returning home, adults after work, retired elderly people, and people with the same interests can gather and be active, I think the community will become more energetic and the educational capacity of the community will be enhanced. There are many people who could be saved by moving to the community, such as children who quit sports they have been following because there is no club they want to play in at school, teachers who are national-level kendo players but are forced to become advisors for the volleyball team, and adults who played in a brass band during school but cannot continue after getting a job. With the declining birth rate, it is expected to become increasingly difficult to compete and perform in group sports.",128,16
"The challenges are very many, but I believe this is the direction we should be moving in as we look to the future. Now that our children have grown up, we can afford to look back. Although the origin of this trend may be the elimination of overtime work for teachers, it has been a long time since the declining birthrate has made it difficult for schools to compete in athletic games and cultural club competitions. The unique Japanese culture of club activities, which is based on the assumption that the population is expanding, is very unique from the perspective of other countries, so we should not take the current situation for granted.",321,34
"Elementary school youth sports club activities were originally separated from the school. Junior high school club activities should be done in the same way. In youth sports clubs, the parents find the leaders. There is no way to have the administration find leaders. If they wish to do it themselves, those who want to do it should find their own leaders. By the way, the leaders of the youth sports clubs are volunteers who are not paid. If leaders are publicly rewarded for the transition of club activities to the local community, then the leaders of the youth sports clubs should be rewarded as well.",382,29
"As for the cost, I think it is just a matter of getting it right, as the cost that should be paid has simply been obscured by the labor service of the teachers. As for the point about transitioning to the community, I think it is a good idea to have more options and more possibilities to participate in club activities that one wants to do, as well as more possibilities to receive more specialized instruction. In a society with a declining birthrate, it may become difficult to maintain school-based club activities even in urban areas, and I hope that this trend will spread quickly.",199,13
"I am the mother of a child who is currently in high school 1 and elementary 6. When my older son was already in the club, we practiced 4 times a week, 2 hours on weekdays and 3 hours on either Saturday or Sunday. I didn't feel like I could get good at it with that kind of practice time, but still we had club activities, and basically because of the rule that you had to join something, I joined the tennis club even though I wasn't good at sports, and I worked hard for two and a half years, and I think it was a great experience. The rhythm of being able to do club activities for two hours after classes, go home in the evening, and go to cram school is very good for junior high school students. Otherwise, they would go home and look at their phones for the rest of their lives. I think that club activities during compulsory education are very important as a rite of passage in life. I hope that club activities will continue to exist under the control of the school.",22,69
"I think it is necessary for the government to support instructors by encouraging companies to allow them to have side jobs, and to take measures such as tax exemption for their income. Also, no one will want to become an instructor unless the parents agree that they will not be held responsible for any problems that occur during club activities. However, in order for teachers to be able to work on weekends, I think it is necessary to eliminate club activities for which there are not enough applicants.",265,36
"I am a school teacher. I have devoted myself to coaching club activities for about 25 years. Thanks to your support, we have been able to participate in national tournaments for both men and women. Now we have changed our policy and made it a ""club"" at school, with activities lasting about one hour four days a week, and we can take a break at any time. Then, surprisingly, many students joined the club by crossing over to outside clubs. For full-fledged activities, we started a local club team. For this purpose, I became a certified coach. Some students who were not satisfied with the club have also joined. The club team has attracted many students from youngsters to junior high school students. The cost was kept as low as possible, with only the cost of insurance, equipment, and supplies. We also participate in official games of the Junior High School Sports Federation as a club team. I feel that the parents are very interested in the program. We no longer get angry at them for teaching. Anyway, they say, ""Today was fun! I made progress! I try to end the day with ""I had fun today! Some high schools are even allowing us to use their gymnasiums.",123,9
"I belonged to a sports club in junior high and high school, not a club. This is because my school did not have any club activities that I wanted to do. In Europe, after school, each student goes to a local sports club and participates in sports activities. At the sports clubs, each student works on improving his or her own athletic skills and joining with the local community. After sports activities, the students go to a restaurant or other facilities to have a meal or go home. The disadvantages of club activities in Japan are (1) increased burden on teachers and (2) sports coaching by teachers who do not specialize in sports. If the burden on teachers increases, their motivation for club activities will decrease and daily classes will be interfered with. In addition, the lack of professional coaching staff makes it difficult to improve athletic performance, and delays in responding to injuries occur. I believe that now is the time for club reform and the opportunity to move club activities to the local community. I hope this post will be of some help.",140,8
"The only way to continue the function of the ""club activities"" currently being performed by high school and junior high school teachers is to transition to the local area. There are some cases where there are no leaders in the region and the transition is not possible, in which case, unfortunately, we have no choice but to consider liquidating (in short, abolishing) the club. It is true that there may be disparities between regions, but that is something for the national and prefectural governments to think about, and I hope that each school will quietly go through the process of transferring club activities to the region, and if that is not possible, consider liquidation. If this is not possible, then I would like to see the schools consider organizing them. If I am wrong, we should not go against the times by having the current staff take over club activities.",90,4
"I have a child in a rural middle school with only one class per grade. I am in favor of having a club team, but many club teams play at night and it is difficult to combine with cram school. It is also difficult to take them to and from school each time. It puts a lot of strain on the parents, and I realize how blessed I was in my days when I could practice at school after school without thinking about it.",50,5
"In junior high school and high school, I was very much indebted to the teachers in my school club activities. I was a child at the time and did not understand how much of a burden I was placing on the teachers, but I believe that the current situation where we are overly dependent on the kindness of the teachers must be changed. It is a matter of course to move to the region, but we hope that we will be able to address any issues that come up in the future accordingly and create an environment where the children can have a good experience.",45,1
"I myself was saved both mentally and physically by club activities throughout junior high and high school. On the other hand, as I grew older, I came to understand that it was supported by the tremendous efforts of the advisors. After all, regional transition is necessary. However, if measures can only be taken at the level of the current club activity instructors, I feel that unfortunately club activities are likely to be reduced in the future. My husband is a club activities instructor at a high school. He was asked to do this by his friend, the advisor, and since it is an extension of his longtime volunteer teaching duties, he has been able to make it work, but I think it is a very rare case. With a capped compensation of several hundred thousand per year, a responsible job that requires highly specialized skills and educational awareness, a decent instructor is hard to find. Furthermore, the remuneration has been reduced this year, but how will they finance the transition to the local area? There is also the problem of finding places for daily practice and equipment (e.g., instruments for a brass band). I think the question is how serious the government is about club activities as a form of education.",38,8
"The significance of club activities should be properly understood from the perspective of education, what role they have played so far as school activities, and how they should be discussed in the future. Which role should be entrusted to the community? In terms of the burden on teachers, I think some of this can be solved by paying them an appropriate allowance. I am not sure if separating club activities from the school will be the only way to motivate teachers. I think that the loss of club activities will create new problems and burden on teachers because they will not be able to grasp the situation of children and provide guidance and training not only in the classroom.",16,18
"In addition to club activities, there are other clubs that are active in the community. Many local clubs are active once or twice a week for about two hours. Club activities are to be steered along the same lines, considering the transition to the community. School activities are also about twice a week. Competitions should be led by parents who see their own children. The goal is to completely separate the school from the school starting in the 2030 school year. Teachers who want to do this will see the activity as an outside leader in their own community. There will be no transfers, so they can do this all the time. If we do the activities twice a week, private clubs will start up and we will be able to separate the clubs for the purpose of community exchange from the clubs that attract children who want to do more.",99,21
"I think we should move to local club teams like in Europe. The reason for this is the issue of leadership. In the case of club activities, most of the teachers who are amateurs in development are single-handedly acting as coaches (or rather, people in charge), so there is almost no one who can guide them to the correct development as players while avoiding the risk of injury. There are also many faculty members who rarely show up at activities. Of course, there are some disadvantages. It is difficult to have many teams in a community, so the burden of attending can be a big one. As for the expense incurred, the question is whether it is better to ""get proper instruction because it is free, or to be left out,"" or whether it is better to get proper instruction and pay for it. Essentially, we believe the latter is preferable.",7,1
"I am an active public high school physical education teacher. I feel that I would like to see a regional transition as soon as possible. Schools are the most terminal of educational institutions. They mostly just follow the instructions that come down from above. Although they do take feedback from the field, or questionnaires, they basically just ""report"" to us. I have heard that the overwhelming majority of junior high schools would like to see the transition to the local community. However, most of the schools and institutions in the prefectures that are considering things related to club activities are probably physical education teachers who do not feel too burdened by club activities. If they are really interested in transitioning to the regional level, I think they need to discuss the issue, including working conditions, etc. I would like to see discussions involving unions, principals' associations, and other organizations that may have some influence among teachers in the field.",33,3
"Students belonging to club teams are now able to participate in this year's middle school competitions. For individual sports, it seems to be rather easy to transition to such club teams. As for team sports, the form will vary depending on the sport and the number of students, with school-based teams for school sports, and local teams for community sports. The problem is to secure instructors, and those who can teach after school and on weekends are likely to be retired senior citizens and teachers who wish to teach. The cost would be borne by the beneficiaries, but it would be realistic to ask teachers to submit a notification of dual employment to secure personnel.",6,2
"I am a middle school teacher. I retired this past March and am currently teaching on a reappointment basis. I have been an advisor for the volleyball team for a long time. With this experience, I have decided to start a volleyball club team. However, neither the students nor the parents in the community are interested at all. They do not give any support to the administration. It is very painful. I hope that they will help us move forward with the steps to transition to the community as soon as possible. Of course, we have no intention of accepting any money as an instructor. However, there will be money for gym fees, sports safety insurance, association registration fees, ball fees, etc. If the government does not back us up, the burden on parents will only increase. We are asking the government and the community. Please give some subsidies to club teams. Thank you very much.",16,18
"Teachers are finding that the significance of club activities is diminishing. Especially in sports-related club activities, good results in games give an advantage for higher education and employment. Parents have strong expectations for this. The children, however, may be genuinely striving toward their dreams. Why not leave such club activities to club teams? Even club activities in the arts, chemistry, and IT should be left to specialists. I think this is a better way to develop children's interests and individuality. Times are changing.",6,1
"I agree. The load on middle school teachers is too high when they take on club activities. Not only do they have to participate late on weekdays, but also on holidays, and furthermore, it is difficult to take paid leave outside of the holiday period. School teachers are a very important profession that influences children's personality development and future way of thinking, in other words, influences the future strength of the nation. Currently, I think it is difficult to say that excellent people, including in terms of income, are aiming to become school teachers. I hope that not only the club activities but also the overall treatment and employment conditions will be improved so that teachers will be respected in society. On a different note, I believe that various improvements could be made quickly if people who have worked in the private sector until their 40s or so could be hired as teachers or on school boards as a second career.",10,4
"I agree with the regional transition. The issue of ""financial burden on parents"" has been raised as an issue, but I think the issue of cost burden should be separated from this issue since this is a measure to reduce the workload of teachers in the first place. However, I think that the issue of cost burden should be separated from the issue of the burden on teachers, since this measure is part of the measures to reduce the burden on teachers in the first place. On the other hand, there are also many teachers for whom ""being involved in club activities"" is one of the reasons to continue teaching. Therefore, in the regional transition, I think it would be a good idea to allow teachers to work as ""regional activity leaders"" on the side, and to give priority to such people in the selection of regional leaders.",1,1
"We have small children and my husband is a middle school teacher. The school where my husband works has a dismissal time of 4:40 p.m., but club activities end at 6:30 p.m. He comes home after 7:00 p.m. no matter how hard he tries. No matter how hard he tries, he comes home after 7:00 p.m., which leaves him with only an hour or so to spend with the little ones. (We leave the house early in the morning, after 7:00 a.m.) On weekends, my husband has very little time to interact with the children because one of them is involved in club activities. When he has an occasional day off, my children would ask, ""Why is daddy off today? I have become almost a one-parent operation. I am almost a one-operator myself, and it is hard for me to rest. In the midst of all this, I cried in frustration when I heard about a student who said that club activities were a pain in the ass. I honestly wonder why our dad has to devote his precious time to such a child. Teachers also have families. Basically, I want them to work during working hours. I would like to see club activities separated from teaching.",7,1
"When I was in junior high school, the world was asking if we could work 24 hours a day. Compared to salaried workers, junior high school teachers could wear shabby clothes, work less overtime, and have full summer vacation, so I decided to become a teacher in the future! I decided to become a teacher in the future! I entered the education department, but gave up when I heard that only one out of tens of thousands of teachers would be hired because of the ""super ice age. Now there is a shortage of teachers, and at my son's school, the vice principal is being sent out to teach classes. I am so mad at the teachers at the school who work late, and there are so many families who need developmental support, and they are so detailed to each of them. They are really accommodating even though they have families and children of their own. The club activities should be shifted to the community to reduce the duties and responsibilities as much as possible.",14,1
"Although my high school was a public school, it had a club that was so active that it was chosen to represent the prefecture every year. The club had more than 100 members in the third grade, and many students came to the school because they wanted to play in the club. However, upon my graduation, the club's advisor moved to a new location. Although we secured an outside instructor once or twice a month, the club declined. We no longer represented the prefecture. On the other hand, after a few years, the school where the teacher was transferred was selected to represent the prefecture.... Was it really a good idea to choose a school for the sake of club activities, and was that the right career path for these children? Because of this kind of experience, why don't we just move the parts of the school that have nothing to do with academics to the community? I think it is a good idea.",71,5
"If it is a club activity, I think it should be carried out as far as possible as a school activity. To take this to an extreme, I think it would be difficult to continue unless the advisors are paid for overtime until school lets out completely after classes end on weekdays, with no weekends. If this is the case, it will naturally become difficult to win competitions, and some parents and students will complain. This is exactly the point that makes club activities difficult: are they doing it to win competitions, or are they doing it as a non-athletic activity and having competitions as a place to show the results? Personally, I think it would be better to do away with club activities, and if students want to play sports other than physical education, they should start their own clubs in the community and separate their activities from the school. In this way, there would be no room for dissatisfaction, since the activities would be carried out by those who want to do them without being forced to do so. I think that because it is done as a school activity, there will be people who have different ideas, and that will lead to dissatisfaction. I think it is time to rethink how conventions should be organized.",4,1
"Compared to when I was a child, I believe that many things in today's world take more time and effort.　These are partly due to the fact that we live in an age where individual rights and claims are protected, and therefore we have to understand that there is an increased burden on the main part of my job as a teacher.　I was blessed to have good teachers and club advisors, and it was a very good experience for me to be able to conduct club activities, but now that I have entered society, I think that what we do with good intentions cannot be forced upon us.　At the very least, I think that teachers and other workers should promote the division of labor if they can ask experts in their fields to help them with the work they do.　If the division of labor allows teachers to spend more time on their main job as teachers, they can spend more time with their students and work on problems such as bullying.",11,5
"I was an outside coach for a soccer team at a public junior high school for about 15 years. What I think is important is the cooperation with the school. I think it is important for the principal to have a clear idea of what he or she wants to do and to work well with the club advisor. If the school receives correct information about club activities and individual children's information closely, it can be dealt with onsite and lead to smooth operations for both parents and students.",5,4
"I am sorry to say this to the teachers, but if someone from the community takes on the responsibility of coaching a club activity and a student collapses and dies of heat stroke during the coaching, I imagine the community support staff would be held responsible in some way. Not many people are willing to take on that kind of potential liability for free or for a modest gratuity. Unless the faculty committee solicits applications with specific conditions, such as wages for instructors, management responsibility system in case of accidents, etc., it is very difficult for us to accept volunteers. That should be easy to imagine for teachers who are currently struggling. What I can't imagine are the people on the school board who are working at their desks. I understand the philosophy of regional transition, but I think it will be extremely difficult to find an undertaker in Japan today.",7,2
"I have been a club activities instructor for three years. The number of days I can work in a year is predetermined. I have to work 4-5 days a week, and if I go to tournaments on weekends, I soon reach that number of days. However, if I don't go, the club activity cannot be held. This is because there is no teacher to watch the club activities. Last year, I was almost a volunteer from November to March. The students were enjoying the club activities and trying their best, so I took on the job for a third year because I like those students and wanted to help them. To be honest, this is not a job I could continue...",53,7
"In our area, where there are no strong sports in the countryside, many people say that if they have to be picked up and dropped off, or if they have to pay additional costs such as facility fees in addition to club fees and equipment fees, then depending on the enthusiasm of the child, they may have to go home. Even in the countryside, there are many nuclear families with both parents working, so it is difficult to pick up and drop off children after classes, and even if they can get there by bicycle in the summer, it is impossible to do it by themselves in winter depending on the location because of the snowfall in the area. In the end, I think it is only possible for those who can afford the money and time. That said, I think it is necessary to reduce the burden on teachers, so I think it would be a good idea to eliminate club activities, the junior high school organization, and if possible, the high school athletic federation. It is reckless to think that students should be given equal opportunities to play sports.",60,6
"In junior high school, there was nothing I wanted to do, so I joined the soccer club ""just for the heck of it. There were a lot of people who joined the club because of the Captain Tsubasa boom, and the treatment of inexperienced players at the elementary school was very rough. Also, the advisor's teaching style was ""throwaway upbringing"" itself. I was a child, so I tended to skip soccer because I was caught up in my surroundings. But if you skip a game, you are punished by running 10 laps or something. Thanks to this, I hated soccer for a long time. In high school, I was able to resume kendo, a sport I had always wanted to do, and I can say that it was a glorious memory of my youth, both strict and fun. I can say that it is a glorious memory of my youth. I was able to know both sides in my life.",32,20
"I am a club activity instructor for an athletic club. The conditions required for a club activity instructor based on my actual experience are: 1) someone who has expertise and experience in athletics and is physically fit, 2) someone who can adjust to the convenience of the school (from 4:00 pm after school to 9:00 pm during summer vacation, and club activities during test periods and school events), 3) someone who can handle being held for several days during expeditions and camps, 4) someone who is okay with unstable employment and average monthly compensation of 60,000-70,000 yen without transportation costs, and 5) someone who can take responsibility for the safety of the children and the instruction even under the above conditions. (5) who can take responsibility for the children's safety and guidance even under the above conditions. The only people who would fit the above criteria would be those who are studying to become teachers or are retired. I myself cannot continue for much longer. Also, the burden would be much heavier if I were to take on administration in addition to teaching. My personal opinion is that it would be ideal if we could have a full-time professional instructor in the form of a clerical or janitorial staff who would be in charge of coaching and managing club activities for several schools.",10,1
"How is it feasible that the law of conservation of mass would change the bearers from teachers, who had accepted to work for free, to the general public, who are not teachers, while the amount of work remains the same and the cost of labor remains the same? It is impossible according to the laws of physics. In terms of reducing the workload, the first prerequisite is that there will be no administrative responsibility for injuries or problems. In terms of labor costs, the only way to achieve this is to have the parents who participate in club activities pay the labor costs of the instructors, on a beneficiary-pays-all basis. Only after these conditions are met will the possibility become apparent.",57,9
"There is talk of moving club activities and leaders from the school to the community, but this will not go well if the position of club activities is left as it is. If club activities are to be moved to organizations outside of schools, they should no longer be positioned as a part of school education, but rather as activities of local sports organizations or organizations set up and operated by parents. If we proceed with a half-hearted approach, we will always be dependent on teachers. The most important thing is to shift the sense of ownership of organization and management from schools to community organizations, parents, and those who wish to participate. To this end, it is necessary to secure a budget, and it is also necessary to develop a system related to the establishment, such as sports injury insurance and rules and regulations related to organizational management. In the midst of such a transition, it is also necessary to revise the law so that if a teacher accepts the role of instructor, he or she can be paid and serve concurrently. Some pupils would use private sports facilities and their parents would bear the costs, while others would be active in community organizations, financed partly by the local budget and partly by their parents.",13,1
"What should be the position of club activities in schools? If the purpose of the activity is for physical and mental development, it should be an after-school activity, but if the purpose is to improve athletic skills and develop excellent athletes, I think it should be a community activity. However, if it is a school club activity, the burden on the teacher is still too great. I would like teachers to concentrate on teaching academics, which is the original purpose of school. If the school teachers want to teach athletics as well, they should participate in community activities. Club activities where amateur teachers show up are unfortunate for both the teacher who has nothing to gain and the students who do not receive proper instruction. (Because that's what happened to my high school club.)",2,1
"More than ten years ago, when I was in junior high school, I was a member of an athletic club. I wondered what kind of club activities were held in countries where the sport was popular, and when I looked into it myself, I was surprised to find that in those countries, club activities were not held at school, but rather, students went to local sports youth organizations after school to practice on their own. However, I have recently come to think that Japan was a rather unique case. Looking back, the 80's was an era of school violence, and I suspect that club activities also played a role in leading the students. If that is the case, I think it would be natural for club activities to change in accordance with the changing times.",33,3
"While some students and teachers find club activities rewarding and enthusiastic, others suffer from exhaustion. Club activities have continued to grow while facing serious problems such as lack of personnel and budgeting. The ""student population decline"" and ""teacher work style reform"" should, of course, be the subject of various opinions from a variety of perspectives. 　Do you, the readers of this newsletter, approve of club activities that are based on the sacrifice and forced labor of teachers? Long hours and overcrowded work of teachers are now a social problem. As a result, there is a serious shortage of teachers throughout Japan. Especially in middle and high schools, club activities are a major factor. It is too late to steer the course toward a regional transition. Although there are many issues to be addressed, I hope that the transition will be made as soon as possible. I think that the option of ""taking on the responsibility at school because the transition is not possible"" is now extremely difficult. Even in the current situation, the number of club activities and activity hours will have to be reduced. Our association believes that at the very least, ""teachers who do not wish to be involved should not be forced to become club activity advisors.",21,1
"I think it should be up to the children who belong to the club, their parents, the school, and the club facility in charge of the club to decide what the local community should do. However, if an accident occurs at the club activity, who will be responsible? I don't know. If it is a school club activity, the school or the board of education will take the initiative and take measures to investigate the cause of the accident. I feel that they would rather just stop using that place and let the problem itself end. You may think that it is not a good idea to start the conversation from the beginning with an accident, but shouldn't we make a proper agreement on that as well?",21,9
"If it is a club activity at school by school faculty, then a full-time club activity teacher should be hired. If that is not possible, then I think it should be abolished. Up until elementary school, students paid to learn what they wanted to do outside of school, so why is it that once they enter junior high school, they are told that it is natural for teachers to do it, and why do people say that children from poor families cannot do sports if there are no club activities in junior high school? People have lost their senses because it is taken for granted that they pay money up to elementary school and receive free of charge once they enter junior high school. Furthermore, in some club activities, verbal abuse by advisors is allowed to some extent, and there is also a lot of bullying by upperclassmen, but when it comes to club activities, they do not make an issue of it unless the student commits suicide. In many cases, things that would get you fired if done in class are tolerated. Club activities are abnormal and should be immediately transferred to the local area or abolished. I am a former teacher and current husband teacher club activity advisor.",70,6
"One of my children was a member of a school club (brass band) and the other was a member of a local club team (soccer). In the past, the policy was that all children had to belong to some club, but now it is only those who wish to do so, and the club team is preparing to be one of the recipients as it moves to the community. However, while the school board is enthusiastic about ""letting go"" of the school, there seems to be little interest in ""handing it over"" in our city, and there is a big difference in support from the neighboring cities. We are not asking for more benefits, but are trying to work together to fix the transition issue, but it seems that there is little cooperation in connecting with organizations other than the newly established recipient organizations of teacher alumni. What I feel is the problem of ""schools are cooperating with the transition in this matter, but there is an overwhelming lack of school board involvement"" and ""people who are teacher alumni and do not want to give up their club activities do not want to connect with non-faculty"".",8,2
"Club activities include not only sports and other technical instruction for both cultural and athletic clubs, but also a variety of other duties, administrative work, and management related to club activities. These include: preparation of practice plans; preparation and implementation of safety measures (measures against injuries); preparation of rosters for participation in tournaments, etc., applications, planning of escorts and accommodation; securing and coordinating locations for practice outside the school (in some cases, payment of money); purchase, management and repair of various club-related items; confirmation and communication of absentees; first aid for injuries in some cases; and coordination with the advisor of the opposing school in the case of practice matches (meetings). In the case of practice matches (meetings), liaison and coordination with the advisor of the opposing school. Many advisors are also responsible for organizing, preparing, and running tournaments, as well as refereeing (judging) and cleaning up. They learn the names of all members, coordinate relationships, listen to the concerns of club members, determine and communicate regular and irregular members, provide guidance to the head of the club, follow up with the head of the club, and deal with parents. A club advisor requires considerable time, effort, ability, and coordination. It is not only technical instruction in sports and other activities. And it is not enough to say, ""Sensei, please"" when you are in trouble.",121,6
"I am a former public high school teacher.　I believe that ""club activities to win"" have been promoted by the existence of ""official competitions"" of the junior high and high school athletic federations, such as chapter tournaments and then national tournaments, based on the premise of school-based teams.　Under such circumstances, advisors are expected to be ""competent athletic leaders"" (even if implicitly), and I believe that many non-specialized advisory teachers have felt mentally distressed.　Also, private schools and even some public schools are currently recruiting students under the slogan of being a ""strong school. （Personally, I think that after-school sports and cultural activities should be ""loose activities"" like the ""compulsory clubs"" that used to be held in the past, and that students who want to specialize should join sports clubs outside of school and aim to compete in tournaments. Students who want to specialize should join sports clubs outside of school and aim to participate in tournaments.　I think this is a good opportunity to rethink the current ""school club activities"" from scratch.",10,1
"I am a former teacher. I write this at the risk of criticism. I think there are few students who don't want to be teachers because they don't like club activities. Of course, there are teachers who are not good at sports, but there are also a surprisingly large number of teachers who say ""club activities are my life. When I was an advisor for a baseball team, one of the teachers I worked with was a former Koshien baseball player. However, he told me that he could not become a professional baseball player and that he became a teacher because he wanted to continue to be involved in baseball. Not all teachers in the world are like that, but club activities are a part of student guidance. It has great educational significance. Without club activities, schools would be no different from cram schools. Students who talk about working hours and club activities should just aim to become tutoring teachers from the beginning. In other words, we are proud to be a public education teacher. I would like to write more, but due to a word limit, I will stop here.",2,2
"If it is not consistent with education, it should be detached. Naturally, it should not be reflected on the internal report. If it is consistent with education, it should be handled appropriately by the faculty. However, not only club activities but also subjects called secondary subjects may be difficult to evaluate. For example, there are people who cannot read music but have a talent for music, and people who cannot appreciate art during their lifetime but can appreciate it after their death.",23,12
"The ideal workplace is set forth in the Labor Standards Law and the Act on Special Measures Concerning Pay and Salary. Schools are also workplaces for teachers. Therefore, it is not worth considering the merits of activities that extend beyond working hours. It is no more than saying, ""We can't maintain club activities because we can't legally operate them without any problems. The children, enthusiasm, and so on are not reasons to transcend the Labor Standards Law.",68,2
"I am in my 60s, but when I was in junior high school, I was in the ""Kyudo Club"" and at that time we had classes on Saturdays, so there were activities that afternoon. All instruction was given by one senior, and the teacher rarely instructed or showed up, including on weekdays. The teacher would come by once a week on his way home, say hello, and that was the usual pattern. I don't know how it was in other clubs, but from my child's point of view at the time, I think the teacher's workload was not so heavy. A second teacher was added in the middle of the year, but he would only lead the team during city tournaments, etc., and would not show up to teach. I only know what it looks like on the surface, but I think that is fine. It is a lot of work for the teachers because they have to stay with the students and provide guidance. If we are going to have activities, including weekends, can't we do it with just the students? Even the competitions are dangerous in a sense because it is Kyudo, but they were such a challenge.",1,1
"In the first place, shouldn't the discussion be about whether club activities are necessary or not? I am in the camp that believes that club activities provide valuable experiences, so I am in the camp that believes they are necessary, but if we are going to discuss club activities, I think we need to start there first. I also think we need to change club activities to recreational activities and club activities as a lifelong sport. I don't see why extracurricular activities need to be so mentally taxing. Recreation is fine. They can freely change the events every six months or so.",4,3
"It was a brass band. If I had not met the brass band, I would have never had the opportunity to experience musical instruments and music. Musical instruments are not cheap, especially large ones costing millions of yen. There is almost no family that can afford to buy one easily. In particular, there are many different types of percussion instruments, and what is needed depends on the song. It would be nice if the school would lend you an instrument, but (although it is unlikely) the cost of reimbursement if you break it will be high, and even if you use it normally, it will need to be maintained on a regular basis. I believe that many of these repair and maintenance costs have been paid by the school in the past. In some cases, the cost of reeds for woodwind instruments may have also been cheaper if they were purchased at the school. From the above, unless financial assistance can be obtained, the hurdle to joining the club will be raised. Also, securing a place to practice will be an issue due to noise problems. I just hope that the opportunities for children to have experiences will not be reduced.",10,3
"In Japan, there are too many volunteers who are not really paid, not only for disaster relief but also for daily community association activities. Even this time, outside leaders are not paid enough to make a living, and it is difficult for those who have jobs to participate. I wonder if it would be possible to create a system to pay volunteers a solid wage. Donations from various companies and individuals, and in some cases, taxpayer funds. If people with various instructor certifications cannot make a living by their certifications, they will not be successful. There are many ordinary people who do not belong to clubs who have instructor certifications. However, they are all reluctant to be involved in club activities. They may hold meetings between outside instructors and teachers, but that is a burden on the teachers. The junior high and high school sports federations have also been dismantled. Either pay the outside instructors well, pay the teachers who want to lead club activities overtime pay, or allow teachers to have a second job and become leaders in clubs.",7,1
"I agree with the regional transition. I thought it was strange to force club activities in the first place. Also, the idea of free personnel expenses if teachers and other advisors serve as advisors is unnatural. However, in reality, I think that opportunities for club activities are very meaningful, and I think it is important to have a system to support such clubs in the community. This requires subsidies, etc., as well as cooperation from the schools in providing facilities. In addition, the cooperation of parents is also necessary for club activities. In this sense, a comprehensive regional organization that includes the local government is necessary, and I think it is necessary to look ahead to the point where as many clubs can be established as there are schools. It is very difficult to create the groundwork for children to have dreams and hopes through club activities, and to interact with other people, not only in the educational aspect, but also in the health aspect.",3,1
"My family member is a middle school teacher and advisor. From their point of view, the lack of time off is extraordinary. It is unthinkable from the perspective of a corporate employee, and it is seen as super black. The only time he can take a day off is during the year-end and New Year's holidays. However, he puts all his energy into his advisor's activities, so I think he is happy to be alive. I mean, if he wasn't that kind of person, he wouldn't be able to keep a job like that for decades. So I think it is good that the advisor is based on the community teaching, but if there is a wish, I would like to leave a way to let the teacher do it.",41,24
"It has been 22 years since I became an outside teacher from PTA president. At the time, there was a lingering aftermath of the 50 million yen incident, and there was also the aspect of nipping delinquency in the bud by shoving it in the bud with club activities. Even back then, I was surprised at the amount of paperwork teachers had to do. When people started talking about work style reform, club activities became the centerpiece of the conversation. I often heard that the young teachers were so occupied with these questionnaires that they would not return home until late at night after finishing their club activities. The strange survey was left unchanged and only club activities were demonized, and now even colleges of education are educating students who want to become teachers in such a way that they are not allowed to say they want to be involved in club activities. I have also heard of cases where students who said they wanted to be involved in club activities at their employment interviews were told that their way of thinking was old-fashioned and were not hired. He said it was strange.",1,1
"I welcome this. I think it is a trend that will make everyone happy. Teachers will have less workload and students will be happy to learn more authentic instruction from specialized instructors. I think that regional disparities are an issue, but I think that the basics can be eliminated. The next issue is the compensation for instructors. How should instructors be evaluated? I have been working as an outside instructor for many years, and I would not accept a position if the remuneration is little more than a sparrow's tears. I think it would be ideal if it becomes a second career for athletes, so that they can devote themselves to competition without worry while they are still active. If they insist on full-time employment, they should be able to offer classes for preventative medicine for the elderly in the mornings and provide support services for teachers. It is currently more difficult to find someone who can teach on a part-time basis, so they should be employed full time.",9,4
"The number of club activities has decreased so much that there is no way to choose. I would love to join a junior high school club because it is a valuable time to experience peer and hierarchical relationships, but the variety is so limited, and I cannot increase the number of clubs because of the burden on the teachers. If you could increase the variety of activities in cooperation with the local community, I think it would be good for both athletic and non-athletic children to have more options and more friends to do what they like together, which would be good for their education. After that, it is important to lay the groundwork for who will manage and support these outside activities. If it is to be like a school activity, the budget will be too high. It is also necessary to have a lot of horizontal cooperation in terms of participation in tournaments and practice matches. It will take time to develop the current club activity system, and there will be many problems. I hope that the Ministry of Education and the Board of Education will not give up on the project and will take responsibility for its completion.",12,21
"Early transition is physically difficult. There are too many challenges. Especially in rural areas, it is impossible to pick up and drop off students if they are both working, so each school needs to have its own transportation to the practice site. If it takes a long time to get there, there is a possibility that students from that school won't even be able to join any local team. It is impossible to introduce a uniform system across the country with the urban measure where there are still many people and several regional teams can be established within a child's bike ride. In fact, rural teachers are against regional transfers. I think teachers really want to be paid overtime to take care of them, and I think we should just give them a decent allowance for that.",6,9
"In order for this measure to be successful, the initial costs must be subsidized. If the first participant bears the burden of securing a place for the activity, as well as tools to be used in common, those who join later will benefit. I think this is a bit unconvincing. I would like to see this kind of thing included in the initial design.",16,3
"The same is true for junior high and high school athletic federation tournaments and high school baseball tournaments sponsored by the Japan High School Baseball Federation, in which teachers are currently involved from preparation to operation. Even after the transition to the regional level, I believe that as long as there are tournaments, they will remain involved in some form or another. It is really hard work to organize the district, city, and prefectural tournaments, as well as the spring, summer, and newcomer tournaments. I am concerned that this behind-the-scenes aspect will be alleviated.",20,1
"If the change is from school-based to community-based, can't it be done with the support of the government? The administration could invite instructors, and the administration could pay for their expenses (individual use of personal items would be borne by the individual). The location could be set up so that the baseball and flower arrangement events are held at Daiichi Junior High School and the soccer and brass band events at Daini Junior High School, for example. If each tournament is held in your town, the local community will support it, and it may lead to revitalization.",70,33
"I am a parent of a junior high school student. In the countryside, there are no trains or buses, and students may not be able to participate in the club activities they want to do if they cannot travel by bicycle. It is also an area with heavy snowfall, so if students have to travel by themselves, they may not be able to go to school depending on the weather. Many households in the area have two working parents, so it is difficult for parents to take their children to and from school. Some children may or may not take the time to travel, and if club fees are too high, it will be like joining a club team instead of a club activity. The poor households will not be able to do anything. Also, the current advisor said that he became a teacher because he wanted to teach club activities. Can a faculty member teach if they wish to do so, even if it is an external transition? I believe that club activities are better within the school as well as for communication between teachers and students within the school. Isn't it wrong to think that in large Japan, urban and rural areas can be handled in the same way? We threw the Corona response to each municipality...",8,3
"Increase the number of teachers and administrative staff in schools to reduce teacher workload and provide adequate salaries. And of course, for club activities. What about the gradual transition of those with leaders to the local community? However, the leaders will not be there permanently, so what will happen when they are no longer there? This should also be taken into consideration beforehand. It is difficult to imagine that all club activities can be transferred to all regions (especially in rural municipalities), so we need to consider what will happen if students want to participate but cannot due to lack of leaders, or else the regional disparity will only widen.",3,3
"School club activities have the weakness that children's growth varies depending on the leadership and skills of the advisors and coaches. Whether or not a child can belong to a club with a good teacher is largely a matter of luck, and many children may not be able to develop their individual talents. I think that if children are able to gather under more professional instructors in the community, these problems can be reduced and the potential of children can be expanded. When a child wins a tournament, a banner is hung in the school building to advertise it, but the child should be the star of the show, not the school for the sake of the child.",22,9
"My son, a seventh grader, was on the basketball team until last year. Fortunately, a parent of a member of the team has basketball experience and is now teaching him, but the kids and parents are confused because of the sudden change. The kids and their parents are confused because of the sudden change. They are practicing hard for tournaments while feeling a sense of loss that the school and teachers have abandoned them. I understand the burden on the teachers, but I would like to see a step-by-step transition to the local area. Please think of the children first.",8,29
"In the big picture, I think the regional transition is necessary. However, I sometimes feel ambiguous as to whether this is really for the sake of the children or just a measure to prevent the loss of club activities for the time being. The situation would be different if the club activities were not sports club activities, which was discussed earlier, but cultural club activities such as brass band clubs that have competitions, etc. For example, in the case of brass band clubs, the competitions are held in the community. For example, in the case of brass bands, local music stores and music schools are expected to be involved in the transition to the local community, but the school will no longer have a third-party perspective in the purchase of expensive instruments. In addition, the involvement of gyms, classrooms, and other companies in both athletic and cultural activities could create an environment that forces children to compete even more than they do now. The presence of club activities in the current school education system is an advantage for children, with the exception of black club activities. In terms of teacher burden, I think it would certainly be better to promote a regional transition. It would benefit the children in a roundabout way. However, the method itself should not be to the detriment of the children.",11,19
"As the issue has already been raised, I think we should of course proceed, considering the burden on teachers. I have no objection to that. However, if we are going to move forward with the regional transition, we need to be well prepared. On the other hand, we should not proceed without such preparations in place. I believe that this would do more harm than good to the students. Reducing the burden on teachers is the most important thing, but we must also consider the students a little. For example, forcing the transition to a regional area and bringing in a poor quality outside coach who is abusive and favors some members of the club will not be good for the students. Such preparations should be put in place.",27,21
"We understand that the time children spend active in club activities can be a relief to working parents. Nevertheless, we believe that teachers should stop managing club activities. After all, managing club activities puts too much of a burden on teachers. Of course, there are teachers who are totally fine with it and would rather live for it. But that would be an exception to the rule, or else it would be a strange situation. Club activities are also working hours. The term ""educator"" should not be used to cover it up. The number of children is decreasing and it must be difficult to maintain the number of clubs. I think it would be better for the children to join private athletic and cultural clubs and fee-based facilities. For these reasons, I agree with the idea of moving the club to the local community.",21,2
"I am an in-service teacher. I don't think it is possible to transition all of them to the region. Major sports are fine, but what about minor sports? What about cultural clubs? What are we going to do? 1. the best thing would be to allow dual positions and let those who want to do it teach club activities and get paid for it. I think the problem is that there is too little differentiation between homeroom teachers and club leaders. I also think that teaching is a job that is difficult to replace. Therefore, no matter how many people are hired, unless, for example, the number of students in a class is increased to 30 or classes are divided by subject in elementary schools, I feel that even if more people are hired, the number of people who do not do the work will only increase.",52,14
"I would like to see them outsourced, but also leave a form for teachers who want to lead to raise their hands. I personally don't want to wait because I don't have a passion for it and I didn't become a teacher because I wanted to lead club activities. However, there are people who want to do it. Some people say that those people should quit and become outside instructors, but I think that is a bit harsh. The important thing is that club activities are voluntary activities of students. Therefore, it is not right for teachers to be bound by them. Teachers can choose not to be involved in club activities or to be involved. There are many teachers who do not get involved, so outside instructors are essential. Finally, it is important to note that whether or not a teacher is involved in club activities does not affect his/her performance. (Those who do are doing it because they like it.) I think it is like this.",6,9
"My friend's child is going to join a baseball team when he enters junior high school. The reason is that he is in his 6th year of high school and has been interested in baseball since the latter half of his 5th year, so it is not a good idea for him to join a youth baseball team. The club will accept a wide range of players from serious kids to beginners. My concern when it comes to the regional transition is whether there is a place for beginners there. The threshold will be higher than school club activities, and I wonder if this could lead to a decrease in the number of competitive players.",4,7
"I think it is necessary to create an activity organization with the involvement of the government, not as a receptacle for club activities, but with an eye toward the development of the elementary, junior high, and high school age children, and to abolish club activities themselves. If a private company with a view to competitions gets involved, it is obvious that they will become victory-oriented in order to win children. It's too early to say, because there are quite a few private high school clubs where that is the case.",13,1
"I am in favor of moving it to the region. There were times when I felt that teachers gave preferential, if not special, treatment to students in my division. In general, classes for major subjects should be basically the same nationwide satellite classes, and only the follow-up classes should be given by teachers. I think this would eliminate the unfairness of the teachers. I asked a friend of mine about his salary, and he said that although teachers may be lightly paid in terms of hours, it is usually higher than that of ordinary civil servants. I was actually surprised because I had thought that the news reports said that the work was hard, there were no holidays, and the salary was low.",5,5
"Not only in sports, but it is common for school teachers to throw out what they cannot teach at school to outside organizations. Not only is it common, but it is also common for schools to have local schools help with school events free of charge with the attitude that they don't care about the curriculum of the various schools and practices. If you outsource, you have to pay proper remuneration, and I don't think it's right to treat outsiders as if they are volunteers just because it's hard for teachers. If you can't do it, you may need to get help, but don't you need to scrutinize the situation, such as quitting? I think that sports, arts, and special studies should be taught in a non-school environment so that they can grow in their abilities.",17,23
"It seems that club activities can now be transferred to local club teams or dojo and participate in Jr. High competitions, but it will cost 40,000-50,000 yen for hearings and further training for the person in charge to register. Who is going to pay for this? For group sports, but for individual sports, the burden per person is too great. Why are the hurdles so high when the reform is intended to encourage children to continue playing sports and expand the scope of each sport, but the burden on teachers is too great and there is a shortage of instructors?",10,3
"I'm all for ""regional migration."" When I was a student myself, I was very active in club activities. When I was in elementary school, I was a member of a team made up of children selected from various schools in the area, but when I entered junior high school, I had to join the club activities of each school. At the time, I remember feeling a little uncomfortable about this. In addition, the elementary school team had a total of five coaches who regularly competed in prefectural tournaments, but in junior high school, there were two coaches: the teacher in charge and a deputy teacher. It is true that we are putting a burden on the teachers who have taken on the job almost exclusively on a volunteer basis, but when we think about the future growth of the children, we think that they would be happier if they could make a ""regional transition"" and play at a higher level, aiming higher. You should do high school too.",3,1
"I think it's great that the transition to the local community is happening, but there are a lot of people who have flexible hours for weekday club activities,....... I also coach elementary school sports, and it's true that there are a certain number of volunteer instructors who are strange.  There are many hurdles to overcome.",5,1
"I am all for the regional transition of club activities. My child is in an athletic club at a middle school. In the case of public junior high schools, you can't choose the school, so it is up to luck whether you have a good advisor and your child can grow. The advisor at my child's school does not participate in club activities and only practices on his own every day, so the kids who want to improve are frustrated that they get no guidance at all. Schools with enthusiastic advisors are always in the top ranks in inter-school competitions. We would like to send them to a club team if there was one in the area, but the transportation is very bad and we have to drive to and from the school, which is difficult for a working family. I always wonder if this environmental disparity can somehow be resolved.",3,3
"I want you to know that some of us are forced to change the club activities we take on because of school circumstances or because of staff members around us who do not want to play club activities. The know-how of the practice of the sport, the time spent studying to obtain it, and the relationships between advisors, all acquired over several years, are all par for the course. If you say that club activities are important, try having club activities outside of your specialty. I want you to know how hard it is to learn from scratch in a world you know nothing about, where students are more capable than you. Especially PE teachers, please try to have a cultural club. I still want to do club activities. Can you say it is important? I keep feeling self-loathing that my students would grow more if they had someone with more expertise as their advisor every time. That is why I would like to see a transition to the community and have someone with expertise to teach. And I hope for a society where those with expertise can teach high school students without having to choose a teacher.",3,1
"Not to move it to the community or anything, but just get rid of the club activities themselves. If there is something they want to do, they can pay a monthly fee to learn. I think it would be better to do away with the current system in which club activities give students an advantage in entering high school. The future is largely determined by which high school you go to. What is important for children is studying, and they should have more time to study.",30,5
"Only in Japan are teachers forced to join club activities and are also required to be involved in coaching. In other countries, club activities are either organized jointly with local sports clubs, or the burden on teachers is so heavy that club activities themselves are not even considered.",35,2
"I am a high school teacher. My own children are now adults and usually live freely. I am currently the advisor of the boys' athletic team, and since I have been playing the same sport for many years, we sometimes go into practice together. The coach is a man and I am a woman. We share roles and I teach them about daily life. They are high school boys, but they consult with me about everything from school to their personal lives. I think they probably talk to me about things they can't even tell their parents. They are like family. I miss seeing them on days when I can't attend club activities because of other work. If we were to transition to the community, we wouldn't be able to build these relationships anymore either.",5,14
"The soccer and baseball teams at the elementary school my child attended were taught by volunteers from the community who opened the school grounds to the public free of charge. Even in junior high and high school, famous schools and private schools seem to have appropriate people teaching. （In this respect, I think it is reasonable to pay an honorarium to have an outside person teach and the school only provides a venue. If teachers concentrate on teaching and other activities, and do not open themselves up to club activities, which are a form of overtime work, I think there will be no one left to become a teacher. In addition, there are students for whom club activities are sufficient even without a leader, and I agree with this style, at least in the sense that it reduces the teacher's workload.",10,2
"It is a basic premise that teachers need to reduce their workload. However, there are some areas where there is not a good off-campus environment, and club activities are a good opportunity for children who are unable to take lessons (especially due to financial problems). I don't think it is possible to eliminate all club activities in the whole country at once. I am also worried about the lack of exercise for children who have to participate in some club activities, because I think there are a lot of people who used to be in sports clubs because they are not bad at sports. If you ask me what should be done then, I can't give you a clear opinion.",3,1
"Leave it to the local leadership. Before that can happen, we need to elect that leader. And we need to establish a method for selecting those leaders, etc. We need to determine the suitability of the instructors at a training session. On the technical side, I think we should consider cooperation from various professional sports organizations. I think the same applies to the humanities. To go that far would require considerable financial resources. I have high expectations for the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.",1,1
"The best landing place would be to completely separate all club activities from schooling on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and holiday competitions. There is no such thing as ""bridging the experience gap in club activities."" Rather, it is the opposite. For example, if you are from an area where it doesn't snow, even if you want to play ski club, you can't, but the experience gap will never be closed. For example, if you want to take piano lessons but it costs money, there is no ""piano club. It is natural that people who ""want to be able to play the piano"" take piano lessons for a fee. Therefore, it is desirable to pay for what you want to learn. We believe that the final and reasonable landing point is to shift all club activities to activities in the community. This will increase the number of people who are active in the community and revitalize the community. And if people know that a certain area is active in a certain activity, it is possible that people from all over the country will gather there during long vacations and other events.",10,3
"I think the regional transition is fine. I think the problem is that club activities are becoming more like clubs. Maybe it's just my son's school, but it's noticeable compared to the past that students can't greet each other, are lazy, etc. Some people say that the times are different now. However, if club activities are a part of education, I think that without the fundamentals of greetings and attitude toward work, there should even be no club activities.",7,2
"Before considering the regional transition of music club activities, the government needs to make a clear judgment on the ""payment of performance rights fees. Many people are unaware of this, but JASRAC has begun collecting performance right fees from music schools after a court ruling that a teacher showing a model to students in a music class is an ""act of performance for the purpose of being heard by the public,"" and therefore, performance right fees should be paid according to the time of the model performance. Club activities do not require payment of a performance right fee because the school is a non-profit organization that does not collect any nominal amount of money from the students and does not pay any nominal amount of remuneration to the teachers. However, if the region is transferred to a different region and the instructor is paid a transportation fee or some other gratuity, it is no longer free of charge and is subject to the collection of a performance rights fee. However, if the club activity leaders are to be transferred to the regional level and the instructors are to be paid travel expenses or some other gratuity, they will not be paid nothing and will be subject to the performance right fee.",11,1
"There is an assumption that club activities are educational activities that are not part of the curriculum and are carried out at the discretion of the school principal. The transition to the private sector must be a very rough one. This is actually the first year of the transition period, but I feel that the current situation has not progressed one step forward. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology - Sports Agency - National Junior High School Athletic Federation - Junior High School Athletic Federations of each prefecture - school principals - specialized department heads - teachers. The measures that are coming down this way are not in their original form. As a result, the wrinkles from the teachers' work style reforms are only being passed on to the leaders engaged in local sports. This is the only way I can think of for the first year. In addition, the teachers are only able to act on orders from the top and are not able to incorporate the opinions of the field (local community + club activities), and the students and parents who are swept up in this issue are left with financial problems that they cannot support. The construction of the system is pretentious, but it smells like a ""let's move all the troublesome things to the local community! I can smell it in the air.",4,1
"There was no baseball team at my junior high school, so I belonged to a local baseball team. I have good memories of being able to go on trips and play against strong teams. The coach and manager knew baseball very well and taught me many things about the game. I really enjoyed it because I could concentrate on baseball and not on my studies.",11,10
"Why do they have to join club activities in the first place? It is said that it is to avoid delinquency. What I wanted to do was not in school club activities. I was not interested in delinquency either. On the other hand, there are teachers who love their discipline and teach it passionately. As long as there is no excessive teaching. As for outside professional instructors, if it reduces the workload of the teachers and raises the level of the club, I think it would be good if they were more widespread. As long as they don't bring in strange people who make the news. If my area of expertise is not in the school's club, I would like it to be OK if I am not forced to join the club.",46,4
"If the club activities are victory-oriented, they should be moved to existing club teams in the community or neighborhood for now. In fact, some Olympic athletes have become strong in some sports, such as table tennis, gymnastics, hard tennis, golf, and figure skating, which are not part of middle school club activities, but are part of individual or club teams. Many parents send their children to these schools even if they are far away if they are not in the community. Cultural activities can also be done by local groups. The idea of leaving it up to others, like school clubs, that they are close by and can be done for free, is outdated. If more people spend money on these activities, employment will increase and the economy will revolve around them. From a different perspective, the current situation is that it is difficult to manage club teams because they are doing for free what is profitable for public education. If the purpose is to create opportunities for exposure to competitive and cultural activities (non-win-win principle), then we should restore the ""club activity"" time that used to be one hour (50 minutes) per week.",28,8
"It has been said that the government spends less money on children than in other countries, but the fact that this money is given to families in the form of child allowances is in itself a wrong direction. Teachers should be paid overtime whether they teach club activities or not. Free for teachers and paid for the community?　That is ridiculous. If they are to continue as club activities, they should set up a budget and discuss whether they should be free or paid, regardless of whether they are conducted by the school or the community. In any case, how to deal with the various activities that are already being conducted for a fee is more problematic. Generally speaking, we sometimes hear reports that the percentage of budget spent on children is small compared to other countries, but we never hear that it is large. It would be fine if a large budget leads to a virtuous circle in Japanese society, but what is going on? I would like you to report on that as well. And the budget that is wasted should be used for other things, such as measures for the declining birthrate. But, I guess that a large budget can only be a result of interest-related issues.",4,2
"I have been a youth sports coach for many years and an outside coach at a middle school. The advisor receives a small stipend, but the outside coach is completely volunteer. As a non-professional advisor, I can't take off days off from practice and I have to be on duty for two days at tournaments. I think that only a few of the current outside coaches would be able to continue if they were forced to take on that much responsibility. In my case, I am a salaried employee, so I would appreciate it financially if it is recognized as a side job, but if weekends are treated as work, I would have to reduce my work hours at my day job due to the Labor Standards Act. Comments follow.",7,1
"I was a member of the club 20 years ago. That advisor's style was cutting edge. Voluntary training on weekends. Voluntary training on long vacations. Weekday menus were written on the blackboard, and the head of the club would lead the team to complete the menus. No advisor. Even with this style, some of the students went to the nationals and the Kanto region. If you only think of the menu, the students will do the rest on their own. You can have them come only for competitions and leave the rest to them.",5,2
"If free participation is the premise, club activities themselves are a good thing. On the other hand, becoming an advisor and guiding children in a field outside of one's specialty is in itself unreasonable and not one's original job. Moreover, if it leads to overwork, it would also be a cause of violation of the law, even if you are a specialist. Regardless of the pros and cons of moving to the community, separation from teachers is unavoidable. However, it is not a good idea to place a burden on parents. Some children may not be able to participate in club activities due to parental income or other reasons. The school board should provide rewards.",4,5
"We can't go thinking that if we start something, we will lose something. Enough of society thinking that if you have guts, you can do anything, and if you don't do well, you are unmotivated.... It is a given that if you continue club activities, your academic performance will drop (there are exceptions, but those exceptions are exceptions...). It is also a given that teachers' work will increase. Instead of stopping slowly, they should switch all at once.",9,2
"I generally agree with the transition of club activities to the region. Personally, I think the problem is that if a teacher who has never played the competitions, etc., of the club activity he/she has taken on is in charge of it, it would be better to have an experienced instructor from the region. Where there is a proper instructor, I think the current form of club activities is fine. I played the same sport from elementary school to high school, but I belonged to a club from elementary school and the teachers were just volunteers who wanted to have fun, so I was weak. I practiced with the adults in the local clubs after club activities. In high school, I was able to receive coaching from a national-level athlete in my club activities. I think it is not right to shift all club activities to the local community because I have experienced growth by doing so.",4,1
"I have experience both as a parent of a child and as an instructor of other people's children. Compulsory education allows everyone to receive a certain level of education, and club activities are no different, allowing children to experience sports equally regardless of parental wealth. I would like to teach this to children who are talented in sports but are unable to join a club due to lack of parental support, or children who dislike physical education because they don't know the joy of sports! （I would like to teach this to the children whose parents have no money or time to spare and who are being turned away by their parents!　I always want to teach them.",7,4
"Many regional entities have collapsed and the only ones left are the schools. So moving club activities to the community would be effectively abolishing them, except for club operations and private junior high schools. So, rather than what to do about club activities, we should be thinking about how to create community activities. First of all, I think we need to revive vertical exchange, not peer-to-peer exchange. For example, there is no point in moving to a place where there is no source of recipients at all unless we increase the number of students in one school by making it an integrated middle and high school, and furthermore, have a place where university students and working people can get together and do something, etc. I don't think there will be a solution unless we fundamentally change the thinking of the era when the population was large enough to be able to say that this is a far cry from the club activities of our own time.",8,2
"If club activities, which are a part of school education, are shifted to the community, it is good if there is a sports organization in the community, but if there is no organization for all sports, who will be responsible for taking care of them? Also, to whom will the responsibility of the schools be transferred? Who will secure the budget for this? If the concept of ""beneficiary pays"" is introduced, what will be done with the children of families who have the ability but lack the financial resources to attend community organizations? If there are companies that operate sports clubs, but if there are no companies, then local sports organizations (e.g., youth sports clubs) will be responsible for the clubs. Do local communities have the capacity and leadership skills to do so? There are so many problems. The issues are different from region to region, and it seems strange to create a uniform trend of moving club activities to the local area. Now we go to competitions with our school's name on our shoulders, but after the transition, what name will we go to competitions with? It's all unorganized.",6,9
"On the other hand, it has been pointed out that this could increase the financial burden on parents, as they would have to pay rewards to instructors and incur other expenses that they would not have to pay if the club activities were conducted on a school-wide basis."" According to the Special Pay Act, public school teachers are not entitled to overtime pay in exchange for a teacher adjustment amount (4% of their main salary). The reason why teachers have not been paid for club activities in the past is that under the special pay law, teachers have been providing (or being forced to provide) club activities instruction ""voluntarily and on their own initiative"". To put it in an extreme way, students and parents are not paying for the ""time and energy"" of the teachers, but are receiving their services free of charge. There is a concern that the transition to the region will create a new financial burden for parents. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology estimates that unpaid overtime wages for teachers amount to 1 trillion yen. As the working population declines, it is necessary for people to understand that the era of receiving services free of charge is over.",113,1
"If you are going to do it, do it, but I want you to make a quick changeover with a breakdown of what year you are going to do it. If it is done too slowly, children will be confused during the transition period. Personally, I feel that teachers should concentrate only on teaching at school. There are too many teachers who can't even do that. I would like them to give proper lessons so that there is no need for cram school, and in order to do that, they don't need to do club activities, they need to study. I would also like the city to properly manage the after-school gymnasiums and grounds so that the principals don't do whatever they want and release them to the private sector so that the children can spend meaningful time playing sports or doing other things.",3,1
"I think the biggest challenge is to find leaders. How many people are there in the community who are willing to take care of children's lives on weekday evenings and holidays and deal with problems between children and between parents? Recently, more and more children are paying for clubs and other activities with parental transportation, and we are seeing a situation where school club activities are not attracting people. This is becoming a sports disparity in terms of parental awareness and cooperation, as well as financial matters. School club activities, which provided opportunities for everyone, are disappearing, and opportunities and places to play sports as a form of social sports that is not centered on competition are being lost. Children and their parents are spending money and time to gather in more competitive organizations. In the end, children are gathering at places that are the opposite of what the government and the national government are aiming for. The government has not taken into consideration the needs of the children and their parents, and has only focused on reducing the burden on teachers and has not taken appropriate measures.",12,41
"Let's get rid of the middle school sports associations. It would be quicker if it were all done by sports associations. As long as the JCBA exists, even if it is transferred to the regions, it is the teachers who will be sent out to serve as officers, etc. In other words, they are just pawns to be hired at a low price. In other words, they are just pawns that can be hired cheaply. The interesting thing about teachers is that they become officers of a junior high school sports federation without knowing it, even though they are not members.",12,1
"For myself, I am half in favor of separating club activities from this matter. I think it is certainly strange for teachers to work overtime and sacrifice their own families to advise club activities. However, living in a rural area, there are not many types of outside learning opportunities, unlike in urban areas, and the brass band and art clubs that used to be a part of club activities are no longer available.　If club activities are cut off in this situation, eventually the only children who will be able to develop their potential will be the children of those who have money in urban areas. Therefore, I think we should first work on improving local clubs first and reduce club activities over time. Finally, I think it is very difficult for all teachers. However, those who are currently teaching must have known this when they became teachers, and I wonder about teachers who say, ""Club activities are bad, so let's eliminate them and make it easier.",4,21
"I think it would destroy the child's potential. It would nip the opportunity for equality in the bud. I understand that this would be a burden on the teaching staff, but I think it would have been better to discuss thickening the allowances and other benefits. This has been going on for decades, and I think those who have come here to become faculty members understand this. Low birthrate? Isn't that a different discussion? Wouldn't athletic competitions at local schools become meaningless? It is a pity that the gap is too wide for those who join from high school clubs. Isn't it not education to find the talent and do it?",1,6
"If school club activities are abolished, school-based competitions in high schools would cease. Baseball, soccer, brass band, etc., are all club activities and are mainly run by teachers. Sports recommendations must also be eliminated. Although it would be ideal to separate club activities from schools, in reality it would be difficult and take a long time. Especially in rural areas, where there is no means of transportation, the abolition of club activities would be to the detriment of children. In reality, it would be better to prohibit club activities on weekends and holidays, and limit them to four times a week for a maximum of two hours. Appropriate allowances should be paid for training camps, practice matches, and leading club members to tournaments.",9,2
"This year, my child started middle school and joined a club. We originally lived in a rural area where there were only three club activities, and there were none that my child wanted to join, so we took the entrance exam and moved. In the countryside, there are fewer options and it is an hour commute each way to join a club team. However, the kids who are good at the club teams get together and at junior high school tournaments, they are the best and win by a large margin. It's not fun. There are no close games, and the junior high schools don't get stronger as the better kids come in. The number of students is decreasing, and the more rural the area is, the fewer choices there are for club activities, and only the best kids can join the club teams. Or, it became something that only children from families who can afford the time and money and whose parents can pick them up and drop them off can do. I feel that it is no wonder that today's children are choosing to go home and that their physical strength and athletic ability is declining.",4,1
"I agree. I think there are many advantages to having a community-wide program. For example, athletic clubs can have better quality training and personnel, and it is better to learn from people who know the sport if possible. I think it also depends on how serious the local government is.",2,2
"In the first place, school competitions, including high school baseball games, should be stopped. It is nonsense to force brass bands and other groups to cheer for baseball games. Cultural clubs, particularly science clubs, have very different facilities from school to school, which results in a difference in the level of their activities. Especially in the case of public schools, if the budget allocation to schools is changed to the budget allocation to local clubs, the temperature difference between clubs within schools will disappear. Extracurricular activities should not be a publicity campaign for schools. Schools should specialize in their original purpose of learning.",3,2
"Like a middle school course in a fitness club. I think it would be good to create a high school course. Not everyone wants to compete. But I think there is a need for people who want to exercise their bodies. Well, money is an issue, but if you think about reducing the teacher's workload, wouldn't it be good to pay a few thousand yen a month to go to an outside school?",9,1
"Club activities should be truly voluntary and home-coming clubs should become the norm. It should be normal for about half of the students to go home. Schools are probably taking up too much of a child's time. If they are not good at sports, I think this is stunting their development. It is possible to choose not to participate in club activities from the beginning, or to quit during the course of a club activity, in short, it is up to the individual to decide of their own free will. In some junior high schools, there is a strange custom that parents are summoned if they want to quit a club activity.",15,2
"This club team was established by the regional transition in soft tennis in Himeji. At first, practice sessions were held every week, claiming to improve the technical skills of junior high school students, but the moment they were allowed to compete in official tournaments from April, practice sessions were held only once a month or so. The team is a team of players from local junior clubs who are selected by the prefectural government, and has formed a win-at-all-costs team of only junior players, deviating from the original goal of expanding the scope of soft tennis, which we had heard about. The representative of the team is a teacher who had been an advisor at a junior high school, but resigned from his position as a school advisor to devote himself to the club team. This is a bad example of a measure that was supposed to be a national goal to improve the working environment for teachers and help those who cannot form teams, but has turned out to be a completely different direction. Out-of-prefecture trips seem to be the norm. I just hope that club teams will not be formed in other sports as well, because they have misunderstood the meaning of the word.",2,2
"I left a local club team after one year. There were many activities on weekdays and holidays, it was hard to take time off, and I was so desperate to compete for regular spots that I could not find time to study properly. Fortunately, there were a good number of students in the club, so I changed my club activities and am doing well without much stress. I knew I wanted to spend my youth club activities with the kids at school.",2,4
"I want teachers to reform their work style, it's really hard work. However, there are teachers who are obsessed with club activities, especially in physical education. If you go to practice with a local club team, there are definitely teachers who pressure you to be active in the club. There are kids who want to play in the club teams, but if they are told to give priority to club activities, the kids have no choice but to follow the teacher. I really feel sorry for them. It is not so easy to move to the community. I really feel sorry for the children who cannot do what they want to do.",12,7
"The fundamental problem is the part about the increased burden on parents. The part about not having to pay for the school teachers to continue teaching is a false premise to begin with. If we say that the burden on parents will increase if teachers are not allowed to continue working overtime, then they will have a problem with that. If outsourcing means that parents will have to pay more directly, and not less if the status quo is maintained, then it is understandable that teachers will have to be paid in the future. The problem with this reporter's idea is that they have the option of a fixed price work-as-you-go. Are you saying that if it's outside, it's paid for by parents and if it's faculty, it's paid for by taxpayers? Is the idea that if you are outside, you pay more, but if you are a teacher, you can use them at a lower cost? It is unfortunate that some reporters cannot realize that this kind of thinking is what is causing the blackening of schools in the first place.",8,1
"I think the ""club activity"" system in itself is good, but I don't think it's compulsory for either the students or the teachers. It is up to each person. It is fine for students to choose to go home, and if they don't have an advisor, they can negotiate with the teacher and earnestly ask for one. I think the problem is to try to eliminate such ""hassle"" as much as possible.",10,4
"My two junior high school children are in the soccer club. I feel that this is a good place for them to be because the club is inexpensive and they can be coached and seen not only in soccer but also in their daily lives. We are concerned that if they have to transition to the community, school life and sports will be disconnected. I also feel that for children who want to start that sport in junior high school, joining a local team will be a high bar for them, and I feel that the base of the sport will become narrower. However, I feel that middle school clubs and teams affiliated with soccer associations teach different sports. I am often surprised to find that both coaching and refereeing are often handled by teachers who are not certified by the association. I don't know about other sports, but I would like to see the club activities continue by having a budget that allows us to secure outside instructors with leadership qualifications. In the end, I think it is a matter of education budget.",2,3
"Regional migration is one idea, but before that, shouldn't we calmly reexamine whether or not ""club activities"" have that much significance in the modern age? In addition to the overworked teachers, there have been a number of scandals that have been uncovered recently in clubs that are considered strong and prestigious, such as overzealous coaching by authoritarian advisors and the use of one's position as a leader at a strong school for personal gain. When the scales are weighed against the educational benefits of club activities, which way will the needle tip?",8,2
"I don't know whether this will be done within the framework of the school or in a way that is separate from the school, such as a regional club, but naturally the concept of beneficiary-pays will come out more clearly, so how will the problems caused by economic disparity be solved? Also, problems of power harassment and sexual harassment are occurring even among teachers, although I hope they do not increase in the case of outside instructors.",1,1
"Tokyo Minato Ward and Nagoya City have already outsourced to the private sector, but I heard that some of the leaders, especially in sports club activities, are violent leaders. When outsourcing, since they are instructing children, they should be interviewed under more stringent standards. A system should be created to make it easier for children to speak up against such leaders, and then club activities should be managed accordingly.",1,2
"In fact, it is not nearly as advanced. This is because there is no one to take the place of teachers. Many people are still working in the evening, after school hours. Not many people are willing to give up their weekends and holidays to do it. In rural areas, it is also difficult to get to and from the practice site. The advantage is the reduction of teachers' overtime. Teachers will no longer have to be an officer of the federation for each sport. The disadvantage is that the schools will have to deal with problems that occur in club activities that have been moved to the local area. Lack of human resources in the federation. Club teams will be formed instead of club activities, but they will not be able to make ends meet and will not be able to operate. The federations of each sport also depend on club activities, so it is not easy to make progress. I feel that we will not be able to land on a good landing spot unless we take the plunge and abolish club activities at schools, instead of proceeding gradually.",7,2
"My husband is an in-service junior high school teacher and homeroom teacher and club activity advisor. He comes home at 9:00 p.m. on weekdays (he has to round up his work because it never ends) and goes to work every Saturday and Sunday, and on weekends separately. There are many students at the school where I work who are involved in activities outside of school. For example, there are kids who play soccer in the same club and kids who play on an off-campus team. For example, in the same soccer game, there are children who are involved in club activities and children who are involved in teams outside the school. Since the environment is available, I think it would be good for students to be able to play outside the school. I would like to see a change in the situation where students can participate in activities for free if they are part of a club, by calling in specialized instructors for limited activities, such as a brass band, for which outside activities are difficult for junior high school students, and by requiring students to pay a certain amount of expenses. If teachers were to register in name only, and if club activity instruction were reduced from their jobs, I think the workload for teachers would change dramatically. Without such concrete work improvements, I don't think the number of prospective teachers will increase.",6,1
"There are various issues involved in transitioning school club activities to the community. If the transition is made hastily, students and children will suffer disadvantages (e.g., injuries, inadequate guidance, etc.). Are the instructors capable of providing sufficient guidance? It is also strange that the school is not involved at all in the transition to the local community. I think that school teachers should be involved at the beginning of instructional time or at least in greeting the students. It is strange that the program starts with the elimination of overworked teachers. If overwork is to be eliminated, I think the number of teachers should be increased by reviewing the law on fixed number of teachers.",12,43
"The advantages and disadvantages have already been described in this news item, but it is probably a definite step in the direction of separating club activities from school education. The advantage is that schools can concentrate on their original educational tasks. They will be able to conduct research and preparation for subject instruction after school on weekdays and on Saturdays and Sundays, and will be able to develop more fulfilling classes. The disadvantage would be that it would be difficult to grasp aspects of the individual that can only be seen in club activities. As for outside instructors, the advantage is that they can provide more specialized instruction. In the case of teachers, it was often the case that they became advisors for club activities in which they had no experience at all. The disadvantage would be the availability of human resources. On weekdays, practice hours would be from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. I wonder if there are people who can come to the club for instruction at such a half-way time. Financial resources are also a concern. We also need to be clear about what to do in the event of an accident and where to place the responsibility.",44,6
"The Chiba Prefecture Junior High School Tennis Federation has a closed-door approach to tennis, and although regional sports are allowed to participate in tournaments starting this year, they are not allowed to participate in individual matches (singles and doubles), only in team competitions. However, they cannot participate in individual matches (singles and doubles), but only in team competitions. Even if you win the prefectural tournament, you are not allowed to participate in the Kanto and national tournaments. The advisors of private junior high schools run the junior high school tennis tournaments, which is very convenient for them. I think it is not possible to make the transition to regional sports without improving these areas.",4,1
"I believe that the transition of club activities to the region is intended to reduce the burden on teachers. However, in order to transfer the activities to the region, local government officials and school board members are forced to work long overtime hours every day. The regional transfer of club activities is not intended to reduce the burden, but to transfer the burden from the teachers to someone else. Isn't this a real turnaround?",2,7
"I think that club activity leaders, whether teachers or regional contractors, should be paid well, and teachers should be able to choose which club activities they want to be in charge of. Depending on the club activities, the same teacher may have a very different workload, and some people become teachers because they want to do club activities and others do not. If salaries are paid well, the sense of unfairness and the feeling of being forced to do something can be reduced. If you can't even budget to pay salaries, you don't have to do club activities at school.",1,1
"Regionalization of club activities is a good thing. In other words, I feel that this is the only realistic measure that can be taken in accordance with the actual situation in the field of education. Unless the Ministry of Education admits its past mistakes and implements serious educational reforms, I believe that the local community will be responsible for classroom education everywhere. The day when the traditional profession of ""teacher"" will disappear from Japan is surely approaching.",3,1
"I am not sure if my experience from more than half a century ago will be of any help to you today, but at my school back then, we had a lot of fun (my personal opinion). Of course, as long as we were playing, we were concerned about winning and losing, but that was in its own way. The advisor rarely came to the practice field. He did lead us in games against other teams, though. In those days, it was not easy to watch videos to improve technique and share understanding of strategy and tactics, so the members looked things up in books, talked with each other, and thought about what kind of practice we would do. That is why we were a weak team. We would be overjoyed if we won once or twice in the regional qualifying rounds. Because we ran the team ourselves, I can't say that there was no infighting (especially between grades) or trouble within the team, but we were able to manage through discussion (as I remember it). I think the original purpose of school club activities is to deepen friendships while working toward a common goal through friendly competition among friends.",3,2
"I am all for moving club activities to the community. There is a limit to how much teachers can lead club activities. They are volunteers on weekdays, and on their days off, they are paid 3,000 yen no matter how many hours they lead. If there is an injury, the advisor is responsible. I don't even want to go to training camps. Only teachers who want to do it should do it. I want them to be released from club activities as soon as possible. Some of the young teachers now refuse to take part in club activities from the beginning, and the burden of this is becoming a burden on them. Do something about it as soon as possible.",8,1
"I am an active high school teacher. I believe that one of the goals of club activities is to participate in tournaments. Most of these competitions are run by teachers. Not only on the day of the tournament, but also before the tournament (sometimes several years in advance), a lot of time is allocated to preparation for the tournament. Moreover, there is almost no allowance for that preparation time. If we do not transfer the management of the tournament to the local region, no matter how many club activities are transferred to the local region, the club activities will not leave the hands of the teachers.",5,1
"If we consider the issue of how teachers work, the current situation, in which they are told they can work a fixed amount all the time and it is almost illegal, will no longer have to be changed. However, it will not be an easy transition to the region. How many personnel will be available to provide instruction for only two hours on weekday evenings? Based on the working hours, the monthly income would be about 100,000 yen, which is not enough for a young person to make a living. Some say they are retired old people, but what kind of expertise do they expect? Can we expect them to be patient and treat other people's children in the same way as teachers? We believe that club activities are very significant as a gateway to casual involvement in athletic and cultural activities of interest. It may even confer on a person's lifelong mental and physical health. In the theme of protecting teachers, only the negative aspects of club activities are focused on, but I believe that this should be a win-win solution for both teachers and children.",3,5
"I was slapped for no reason in club activities. I think there were club activities just to win, or to prevent delinquency, or for the convenience of the school, and serious teachers had doubts and difficulties. I think that this is what learning is all about. I hope they will expand nationwide soon.",1,3
"Regarding middle and high schools. I think it is easy to think that outsourcing school club activities to the community will make them better than they are now. It would be better to leave the current situation as it is, with teachers serving as advisors, but with outside personnel filling in to support some of the coaching, administrative work, tournament management, etc. I believe that club activities are also a place for teachers to find good points in students that cannot be seen in the classroom alone, and to provide detailed guidance (in areas that cannot be reached in the classroom alone). Don't you want to be an advisor because you don't like it or because it is a club activity you are not good at? Don't make me laugh. Can someone with that level of experience teach children who don't like or are not good at studying so that they can manage to do so? If you can't overcome your own difficulties, if you can't change yourself, what can you do for others? If you say that club activities are not necessary, are you also saying that you don't need a sports festival or a cultural festival? There are good and bad sides to everything. We should not emphasize only the bad aspects.",10,23
"I agree with the regional transition, but the school board's explanation is not clear with the whole process being thrown to the region. What about inclusion in the internal report when students enter high school? What about the physical, emotional, and financial burden on parents? I don't want the club to become a club, as it is too different from the previous club activities and it is clear that it will affect the future in many ways. I would like to see more concrete explanations and, if you are going to start, a system for the conversion of all club activities into clubs, and only then.",1,5
"Since there is so much trouble even among school teachers, who are bound by fairly strong ""gauges,"" it is frightening what the situation would be like if the school were opened up to the community. In fact, I have heard such a story. Regarding the transition of club activities for girls in junior high school and above to the community, measures against harassment are indispensable.",1,6
"First, I am concerned that we are not getting into a 0 or 100 argument. I am concerned that we don't have to forcibly move club activities to outside areas to where they are fine within the school as they are, and that we can properly choose whether or not to leave club activities to the community. I know this is extreme, but there is a female music teacher who has devoted her life to teaching club activities and has been active for over 30 years without getting married. It is no exaggeration to say that she became a teacher in order to teach club activities. I am concerned that such a person would be swayed by the voices of teachers who do not want to be club activity advisors. Changing the subject, the beauty of club activities is that anyone can easily participate in them within the school. If club activities are outsourced, monthly fees are incurred, and they are transformed into something that is no different from lessons, then this is nothing more than the mere abolition of club activities.",5,13
"I'm guessing that the people who are doing the good work here are the teachers and the people who are pushing the booing mark are the parents. My son has already graduated from middle school, so I'll write what I have to say, but I think the transition of club activities to the local area should be done with the teachers in mind. I think it is too black a profession. However, from a parent's point of view, I feel that I really appreciated the fact that the teachers at the school knew the characteristics of the children and taught them. Anyway, I think it is a bad thing that Japan does not spend much money on education. I think there should be more teachers and an allowance for club activities.",3,8
"The education budget should be devoted intensively to children (including kindergarten) up to the age of 18, and those over 18 (adults) should be responsible for their own education. Club activities, school lunches, school commuting fees, uniforms, and textbooks should all be free. Public schools should offer remedial classes for students who excel but are financially unable to attend cram school. For those students with excellent grades who have financial difficulties but wish to attend a private integrated junior or senior high school, a full scholarship and living support money (about the cost of a part-time job) will be provided. In any case, until the age of 18, we will support students regardless of disparities in academic ability, ability, motivation, and good conduct. After the age of 18 (college, junior college, vocational school), students are responsible for everything. Of course, scholarships with repayment and scholarships that are exempt from repayment will be offered to particularly talented students and to schools with a shortage of human resources, such as nursing and caregivers, if they enter professional jobs that will be in short supply in the future. Those with low academic ability & poor conduct who are unlikely to be able to repay the scholarship will not be allowed to go on to college or other schools. All private school subsidies should also be abolished.",26,3
"Even though we are working to reduce the burden on parents through measures such as free education as part of measures to address the declining birthrate and aging population, you are promoting reforms that may increase the burden on parents, the guardians, instead of reducing the burden on teachers. The pretext for these reforms is the declining birth rate, and the introduction of ""joint club activities with other schools"" and ""introduction of outside instructors. I don't think that reform of work styles is a matter of ""just shifting the burden""....",2,9
"There are two conditions for quality assurance of instructors: the first is the number of people weeded out before they are hired. It is necessary to ""make it so popular that there will be people who want to become instructors but cannot"" through a combination of training and other means. The other is ""liquidity"". This is because an organization quietly rots after decades in the same place. Based on these conditions, there are three possible methods. Each disadvantage is omitted due to character limitation. 1) Economic selection with a certain salary. In this case, provide an opportunity to fire or change instructors based on yearly evaluations from the student side, as in professional sports teams or orchestras. (2) Establish an examination system and make it an honorary position. Have people from already high quality places participate as honorary positions (emoluments), just as legislators in the Meiji era were chosen from the aristocracy. (iii) Set up as a local community circle with no age or other restrictions, and conduct it without a leader or with alternating leadership roles within the circle. In this case, it will be a kind of blockchain situation where everyone keeps an eye on each other.",1,2
"Club activities themselves should be abolished. Children who want to do something other than study can join lessons or club teams. I think the gap will widen, though. I and my three children are very happy to have been a part of ""club activities. It may have been hard work for the advisors, but it was a fulfilling student life.",5,1
"I don't think it will work as it is now. Only school education is making progress, and society is not really willing to accept it. Even telework is a system, but it is returning to the direction of requiring workers to come to work. Companies are putting their own profits first, and workers are putting their own lives first, so there is no mechanism to help them in any way. I understand the need to reform the way people work, but the reality is that it has become a rubbing-together.",2,1
"In the 1980s, there was an accident in which a student died during a club activity when the teacher was not watching. The accident resulted in a lawsuit and the school lost the case and had to pay a large amount of compensation. The school lost the case and had to pay a large amount of compensation. Before that, teachers could go to club activities after doing administrative work in the staff room, so there was relatively little leeway, but now there was no leeway at all. Frankly speaking, we should have thought about how club activities should be organized at that time, such as transitioning to the local area. There was no media coverage. At that time, it was extremely popular to beat teachers.",93,4
"In the first place, we need to think a little bit about the fact that all students have to join a club. It is fine if the students are only involved in club activities one or two days a week like in elementary school, but it is better for students who really want to join, but forcing them to join some club may cause them to dislike school. Especially in the sports clubs, those who have experience in club teams or youth teams can be regulars with the older students from early on, and those who have just started cannot keep up with them. Some children are having a hard time participating in club activities that are supposed to be fun. I understand the importance of cheering and other activities even though they can't participate in tournaments, but they have to stay at the venue from morning until evening. Depending on the size of the school, first-year students are not allowed to use the equipment they bought after entering the school. They can't participate in tournaments because there aren't enough players, or there are too many players, so they can't practice as much as they would like. I don't want to play club activities until I feel like that. Some students say that it is painful to have to listen to their advisors and seniors.",5,3
"I'm not a fan of the club, but I'm a fan of the sporting activities. But considering the huge burden on the parents, if the kids want to play but the parents can't help, can we secure the club members? Personally, I think that if club activities are carefully selected and teachers are assigned to specialize in club activities, it would be possible to secure club members and reduce the burden on teachers, parents, and the community.",3,1
"The intense workload of teachers is not a problem that can be managed by reducing one club activity. It is impossible to maintain the current school functions without dividing the workload between teachers who provide academic instruction and teachers who teach homeroom classes and club activities. Personnel costs will probably need to be increased by about 1.5 times the current level. Even if local instructors for club activities are introduced, those who have no experience in teaching will not understand that club activities are educational activities, and will tend to fall into the trap of victory supremacy. In addition, leaders who are competent enough to achieve both the personal growth of the children and the improvement of their athletic performance will not be regional leaders who do not earn much money. The number of former teachers tends to increase, but when the number of teachers without experience in teaching club activities increases and they retire, there will be no one left to be a community leader. This system of regional advisors is not sustainable at all. If we think that we have solved the problem with such a stopgap measure, Japanese education will soon collapse.",11,2
"As long as club activities are involved, teachers will not be able to work comfortably. Students will be dragged down for the rest of their lives with knee and back injuries due to the intense physical activities they do with their underdeveloped bodies. It may be difficult, but I think that sports and arts should be learned.",3,1
"I agree with the philosophy of regional transition. When considering specific practical measures, if we mix the issues of teacher work style reform, declining birth rates, and the lack of professional leaders in the search for practical measures, all of these issues will be halfway through. We should be bold and focus on the reform of teachers' work styles and discuss practical measures for regional transition. Currently, it is the job of teachers to secure outside instructors, and if teachers are required to do more work related to regional transition, it will be a complete disaster. Who will manage the people (instructors, parents, students), goods (facilities, equipment), money (fees for coaching, membership fee income), and information (negotiations with other organizations, local governments, junior high school federations, etc.) related to regional transition? The substance of teacher work reform will not change unless management and discretion are also transferred to the region, even if in stages over several years.",3,1
"I would have liked to join a karate club myself, but while there is some sort of judo and even kendo in regular junior high schools, there is no such thing as karate. With the declining birthrate, it is very difficult to find a sport you want to play nowadays. Even baseball and soccer teams cannot be formed. So it is nonsense to do it as a club activity in junior high school anymore. I paid to go to a karate dojo myself. Shouldn't it be the same for other sports?",2,2
"Eventually, both parents and children will shun the additional travel time and financial burden and will not participate in club activities. Most children will either go home and watch videos or get together and become delinquents. This will only make them unhealthy. Parents will be busy with work due to higher taxes and higher prices, and there will be few children who can aspire to do well on their own. The unhealthiness of children is going to become a social problem.",2,2
"The biggest problem is that there are many students who say that they go to school because of club activities even though they are not good at studying. But it's not right for teachers to be the victims of club activities, and there are also connections that are developed because of club activities. If you think that you can just do something about club activities while ignoring the underlying factors, you'll never solve this problem.",3,1
"Club activities should be run by students' voluntary activities, and there is no need to force students to join or to assign inexperienced advisors. Inexperienced advisors are unmotivated and cannot provide proper guidance, and even though there is a two-person advisor system, the experienced advisor ends up working alone. Only such hard-working advisors have a heavy workload, such as being the head of the school. The teachers who are busy are extremely busy, and there are quite a few teachers who are not busy. In order to close the gap, it would be better to move them to the local area so that they can focus on their original job as teachers. Some of them neglect researching teaching materials because of club activities. It's a complete reversal of the original plan.",2,1
"The elementary school clubs are already organized by the local community, with volunteers playing table tennis at the A C E school, soccer at the B C D F school, tennis at the CD school, baseball at each school, and minor sports (like pole dancing and ballroom dancing) at only one school, and local middle and high school students and adults are also allowed to participate. My son goes to a school in the next town over and plays tennis once a week with kids from different school districts.",3,1
"The culture of ""club activities"" is said to be unique to Japan. I hear that this culture is unique to Japan. It is possible to see the students in a way that you cannot see in the classroom alone. There may be a small number of people who become teachers because they want to be involved in club activities. How about simply thinking that club activities are a burden? Also, I am concerned that if we ask outside parties to take over club activities, only ""winning"" (in the case of athletic clubs) will be given priority. I would like the ""club activities"" to remain as much as possible. Therefore, I would like to see more compensation for the heavy workload, an increase in the number of teachers (double the current number?), and a rotation of teachers. If we could increase the number of teachers (about double the current number) and have them take charge of club activities on a rotating basis (including teachers from other schools), I think the burden would be lessened. I think this would reduce the burden. After all, isn't this the problem of the government not spending money on education?",1,4
"I'm one of them...some of them wanted to become teachers because they wanted to lead club activities. The hardest work for teachers in terms of both quantity and quality is divisional work, preparation of documents reported by the education bureau, student guidance, and dealing with parents. The official documents also have a detailed format that makes the work quite wasteful and tedious, to be honest. Personally, I would be much happier if they would simplify the tedious and unnecessary clerical work.",18,34
"I am an active middle school teacher, and I believe that the one thing that is always left behind when this topic comes up is the teacher who became a teacher because he/she longs to be a club activities advisor. Of course, the current situation of forcing those who do not want to do so to do so should be improved, but what about teachers who want to do club activity coaching because it is taken to the extreme? I feel that it is a good idea. I am a Japanese language teacher, so I find Japanese language instruction rewarding, but I also find it rewarding to interact with students in club activities, so if club activities were to be eliminated, it would be half as rewarding. Many of my fellow teachers have said that they would have a hard time deciding whether or not to continue teaching if club activities were eliminated. This is not because they are trying to create strong club activities, but because they are convinced that students will grow through club activity instruction, which is different from academic instruction. I believe that teachers do not just teach academics, but also ""educate"" students through their school life. I hope that the voices of current teachers who want to emphasize club activity guidance as well as subject and HR management will also be heard.",2,14
"This is a good opportunity for all of us to remind ourselves that middle school club activities have barely been supported by the dedicated volunteers of the advisors. There is no way we can make the transition to the community in its current form. It is a matter of whether or not parents will be willing to pay to have it done. It is not a question of merit or demerit. The young teachers today don't want to do club activities, so this is a problem that can't be helped.",58,2
"In the first place, you don't need 2-3 hours of practice after school. I was captain of a club in junior high school, and I remember being fed up with the fact that we had club activities all afternoon, even on Saturdays when we were half-done, and usually on weekends as well, and we went to school for about two-thirds of the summer vacation for club activities, so I think we practice too much even though we are not really aiming for the nationals. Long hours of practice and morning practice are starting to be found out to be meaningless these days. I think it would be better if the enjoyable players move around a little bit at school, and the hardcore players are active at local clubs.",13,3
"In high school, there is a kind of segregation between those who want to be involved in club activities and those who want to study hard, but in junior high school, it's both, so it's tough. It seems that there is a sense of trying to prevent students from becoming delinquents, but I think that is the responsibility of the parents and not the school.",3,1
"I am a teacher at a public middle school. There's an injured person who falls down in front of me, and I ask, ""Who's going to help him?"" Who calls the ambulance? ""Who gives first aid?"" I have never heard of a discussion that went on for hours with an injured person left unattended. Even now, when the leaders are thinking about external transfers, there are still many teachers who are suffering from being forced to advise club activities, taking time away from their personal and professional lives. What are the government, parents, and community members doing about it? Are they just letting this problem go on, thinking that ""the teachers will do it anyway"" or ""I can't do it because I don't have the time""? Teachers are forced to become advisors even for events they have no experience in. In such a field, public education has already begun to collapse due to a lack of manpower. As evidence of this, we are hardly able to even prepare for ""classes,"" which should be the most important part of our work. One of my colleagues spends several minutes planning a lesson before going from the staff room to the classroom. This is the reality. How long will this stalling in the name of research and discussion continue?",12,1
"For families whose parents can afford the time for finances, transportation, etc., I think it would be fine to have the club after the region, but for families who cannot afford it, some children may have to give up the club activities, don't you think? I am wondering if a solution to this problem is being considered.",1,2
"The problem of outside coaches is only the tip of the iceberg, and there are many cases where the problem has been resolved by the faculty. The problem of outside coaches in the news is only the tip of the iceberg, and there are many cases where faculty members have come in between and solved the problem. In the first place, if you think that faculty members will continue to advise the local teams as they are, you are too optimistic. The teachers' work style reforms will make student guidance even more difficult, as they will no longer be involved in club activities and will have to do more work in their place, and they will still be busy.",10,15
"From the perspective of Ichi parents, they are in favor of the transition of club activities to the private sector. However, after the transition to the private sector, I am opposed to the club activity leaders becoming leaders of the neighborhood sportsmen's club. My daughter was not only discriminated and harassed by the sportsmen's club leaders and forced to quit from the sportsmen's club, but also stopped going to school for a period of time because of it, as she no longer trusts people. Not only that, but there are many youth sports leaders who are not only teaching for their own reasons and to satisfy their personal desires, but also without understanding the revised rules and policies of the various sports organizations and the proper use of school facilities, and so on. Please understand that transitioning to the private sector also means taking on a certain amount of risk.",23,6

"Personally, I think the way it should be is this. (1) Basically, teachers are prohibited from advising club activities as teachers (no free work). (2) The city and users will split the cost of advisors' salaries and other expenses (3) Basically, advisors will be invited from outside the school (open recruitment or a single recruitment) (4) If (3) is difficult, teachers can work part-time (concurrently) (either at their own school or a neighboring school) (5) In the case of (4), the salary will be the same as that in (3) (6). (6) The city should set a day twice a week when club activities are prohibited. Basically, the beneficiaries should pay. It's like that with swimming, isn't it? Almost everyone belongs to a club team.",4,1
"Teachers. Is it true that ""reforms are underway to move school club activities to the community?"" It does not appear to be underway. If it were underway, the number of club activities and competitions should have decreased this school year, but they haven't decreased a bit. It seems as if there have been situations before where the intention was to ""move school club activities to the community,"" but because leaders could not be found, they were told to ""continue at school for the time being,"" and that ""for the time being"" continued for a long time. If we don't implement ""reforms to eliminate club activities from schools"" instead of ""reforms to move school club activities to the community,"" the number of prospective teachers will decrease, while the number of amateur advisors will increase, not decrease.",5,1
"Even for the ""relaxed"" education system, I can say with certainty that it is a failure. The idea of introducing an English language vendor test into the university entrance examination seems like a good one that has been discouraged. In any case, the way they are thinking is not in line with the actual situation. There is no way that the students will be able to do well if they are left in the hands of people who don't know the students well, such as those who are transitioning to the regional level. If you don't have enough people, you should make more and more joint teams. If you have a small number of students, you can make more and more joint teams, and teachers who know the students well can take turns watching them.",4,6
"Originally, the types of club activities established in each public school (or should I say clubs) varied. Therefore, there were times when there was not necessarily a club activity that one wanted to join. I think this can be solved ""to some extent"" by making club activities common within a certain area, separated from the school, but of course there is the problem of transportation. Some activities are usually online, and joint practices are possible once or twice a month. There are examples like this in online high schools, such as e-sports. The problem is with team sports systems, where you can't practice coordinated play or have practice matches unless you get together with some frequency in the first place. This is the problem. However, speaking of transportation, even before this story broke, there was a problem in depopulated areas as to who would pick up and drop off the students at the tournament venue. Traveling one or two hours each way with children from other families is more psychologically taxing than carrying only one's own children. These issues need to be considered at the same time.",16,3
"It would be wrong to say that the times are different, but in today's junior high schools, after-school club activities are held three days a week for 30 minutes to one hour, and there are no activities during the winter season. In such a situation, activities on Saturdays and Sundays are transferred to the local community (for a fee), so how should the children interact with club activities at school? How can they practice enough to participate in games in such a short time? If this initiative is started in the name of reforming the working style of teachers, we will not hire teachers who work in the afternoon or hire staff members who put more emphasis on club activities. It sacrifices only the children's time, protects only the incumbent teachers, and imposes a burden on the good will of the community. In today's world, it is up to the individual to participate in club activities and to not join or not join paid practices held in the community. If club activities decline while the birthrate declines at an accelerating pace, the base that was expanded in elementary and junior high schools will become narrower, and the population of each sport will probably decline in no time at all.",1,14
"It would be a symbolic transformation of inequality. First of all, there should be a limit on Saturday and Sunday activities, and minimize the number of trips and practice games. The overall balance of junior high school life should be maintained, and those who want to play more can go and learn privately. In this day and age, there is also the use of online videos for technical content. It is the same as video learning in the classroom. The majority of kids are doing it for the love of it, not for competition. Unless the focus is changed, there will be a burden on the teacher, the student, and the parents, and the argument will be, ""What are club activities for?",3,5
"When you become a working adult and have to work and earn your own living expenses, you will have to interact with men and women of all ages, even if you only interacted with your classmates during school. (Except for those who are shut-ins or NEETs and are now at the mercy of their parents. On the other hand, school teachers are becoming more and more aware of their rights as workers due to reforms in the way they work, compliance, etc. (Apart from the traditional trade union membership consciousness.) The intention of club activities to the community is unavoidable! We should not be concerned with daily and holiday activities!",3,1
"The most important thing to remember is that you don't have to go through all the trouble of finding the right person to take care of your child. I don't think public schools, including club activities, will be able to survive in the future without mutual aid.",1,1
"It is natural that there are pros and cons from each side. Even if it were possible to outsource the activities to local leaders, the location of the activities would most likely be at the school due to problems with equipment and facilities. In such cases, teachers from the school would have to come to work. Furthermore, if they are not actually teaching, they will not receive the teaching allowance that is paid for club activities conducted on their days off. It is not that easy.",5,2
"As someone who has been there, I have many fond memories of the club activities, although they were burdensome. It was like a practical training in terms of student understanding and student guidance, as I could see the personalities and characteristics of the students very clearly. The students were getting better and better, and the way they grew to know more and train themselves with their own way of thinking, behavior, language, etc., were becoming more and more independent. There is a figure there that you don't see in tests in school. It was not a matter of money. My own family and health were sacrificed, but I think I was able to force myself to do it because it was a job I wanted. I should have done better, but I was not in an environment where I could say such a thing. If you are not a very energetic person, you will soon become exhausted. I would like to see a review. However, there are some leaders who are willing to make sacrifices and spend time with the children. For such leaders, I would like to see the school teachers do their best by not saying that the special work allowance is now 2,500 yen per day, but that it should be paid more by the public sector or by the parents.",84,134
"Not only advisors, but also many of the officers of the associations are actually school employees. I believe that true reform of club activities will not be possible without dismantling and reorganizing the associations.",40,3
"I wish it would stop because it will make a big difference in the area of residence. It would be better if the city or the state would take the responsibility to arrange for each school to have the personnel to be instructors properly to the countryside. ...... It will be the same as the shortage of doctors in depopulated areas in the countryside! No one will come to the backcountry, and the best ones just leave for the cities. There are a few local junior sports teams, but the coaches are parents, and the children of parents who are good friends are required to join regularly. If you trace them back, they may be relatives of influential local people. As for cultural activities...there are piano classes run by elderly people, but there are no classes for learning brass, woodwind, or percussion instruments. They are old enough to have a disconnected network of people they can call on as instructors. There is also only one painting school in the city. Satellite preparatory schools are the best they can do in this area. I don't want the disparity to widen any further.",1,10
"Please do away with middle school club competitions. My child was in a black club that was active almost 365 days a year and competed in tournaments (as an alternate) until November of his junior year. I couldn't quit due to reasons such as lower PE scores, being ostracized by peers, etc. I was able to go to a private sports high school that was not as good, but I am very worried about my future. Parents with some gifted children are good, but I think that most parents in most families would like to have a balanced student life between study and sports. We would like to see tournaments left to local sports and club activities managed without tournaments.",3,1
"Club activities, for better or worse, are one of the factors that have shaped the Japanese temperament.... The mixture of hot-blooded teachers, hot-blooded/unreasonable coaching, students immersed in the coaching and club activities, and students who are careless and careless about off-campus activities has formed our society as we have grown up....... ...What do you think? Is the world getting better?",2,1
"When I was in elementary school, there was a club called the Shorinji Kempo Club that was suddenly formed after a teacher with experience in Shorinji Kempo was transferred to the school. I think it is a good story about the teacher's experience, but even as a child I wondered what would happen if the teacher was transferred. I also wondered what would happen if I were transferred. ....",6,1
"The regional transition also has the advantage of giving students a place to stay outside of school. Japanese junior high and high school students have almost no place to belong outside of school. If they have a better chance of finding a group to which they feel a sense of belonging, won't this make their lives easier?",8,1
"I think this action is necessary because we live in a time of declining birthrate. There should be sports that enrich the long lives of many people in a healthy way, not just club activities that create honor for professional athletes and coaches who don't get a single piece of the pie for winning.",5,1
"If the reason is because the number of children is declining and teams cannot be formed, I agree with the regional transition. However, I do not agree that it is to reduce the burden on teachers. Can we say that club activities are the root of all the evils that keep teachers busy? Rather, the other tasks such as useless surveys, tests, and ICT that are imposed from above are much more painful. It is much more productive to be doing club activities. I don't feel that if we make the transition to regional club activities, we will be forced to do even more unreasonable work than before.",8,6
"Many of the comments, which appear to be from educators, state that they are dissatisfied with being forced to advise club activities because of the long work hours involved in coaching club activities. If this is the case, then club activities should be abolished in public schools and Koshien and national high school soccer should be events only for wealthy private schools. This could be done immediately.",2,1
"The regional transition would only be implemented in a very small portion of the region. First of all, local leaders will not be available, and their teaching time will be limited. Furthermore, when parents are faced with the reality that they have to pay rewards to the instructors, they will never be ""in favor"" of the program.",18,5
"The challenges of regional transition pointed out in the article include the financial burden of incurring rewards for instructors, etc., which were not charged for school-based club activities, and the lack of outside instructors who have contact with students. However, the reason that club activities do not charge for instructional fees, etc., is that teachers are currently forced to work for free, at a fixed rate, for as long as they work. This is because they are forced to work even on weekends like slaves. Can the illegal state of exploiting teachers be allowed to continue? In addition, teaching is a black job where the average monthly overtime exceeds the line for death from overwork. Club activities are a contributing factor. Under such circumstances, what is reported daily is the shortage of teachers and the collapse of public education. While they are saying leisurely things such as, ""It is difficult and impossible to shift to the region because of the lack of outside instructors,"" public education is sure to collapse because young people are evading the program and teachers cannot be secured. There is no time to wait. Club activities should either be taken over by the local community or, if this is not possible, they should be abolished once and eliminated from schools.",49,2
"It's not a Dr. X line, but the biggest obstacle is that there is no time to devote to the original job because everything is incorporated into the job, even ""jobs that can be done without a teaching license"". The division of school duties should be eliminated. It is not right that a math teacher is also a library teacher, or that he/she is in charge of closing the school lunch account, or that he/she manages the collection of club fees. First of all, this area should be scrutinized. Then, there will be people who can afford to lead club activities and want to do so, so they should be paid accordingly. Also, club activities should be changed every season like in other countries. That way, we can ask local leaders only during the season, and we might be able to find a few leaders. No one will take on the job if they have to do it all day, every day, but if it is only for 3-4 months a year, there might be someone willing to do it. Kids should also try different things, not just one sport. Even a kid who is an all-time substitute might have a chance in another sport.",3,1
"Asking the community to help with club activities... Can they ""guide and educate"" adolescents just because they ""can compete?""　If there is violent behavior there, who will take responsibility?　What about advance personnel training for ""amateurs in education?"" It is necessary to reduce the burden on teachers, but isn't it also valuable to interact with students through club activities? I don't think this issue can be resolved only within the Chiyoda building, by bureaucrats who are amateurs in education, and by teachers who are up in the field and have only experienced elite education... I think we need to have more discussions rooted in the field...",5,3
"What happens when a teacher who does not want to be in charge of a club activity does so? They discreetly discourage students and reduce the amount of time they spend on activities, they leave the club unattended whether students stop coming or not, they treat applications for practice games from other schools with contempt and try to prevent them from coming, they pray for the club to lose the games, and when the club stops functioning and the number of students decreases, they gladly ask the guidance department about the abolition of the club. I am exaggerating a little, but that is how they have been treating the club activities. I feel very sorry for the students, but there is a part of me that justifies it as a result of forcing the teachers to take part in club activities that they have no interest in. The middle and high schools should be moved to the region as soon as possible.",4,2
"In addition to the usual club activities such as baseball, soccer, tennis, etc., I would like to see the spread of club activities that are useful for the future, such as programming, an English-only environment, and learning business and finance, for example.",3,1
"School teachers are really busy. It is essential for future children to have good teachers who are energetic and stay. Not being tired or overworked is the light for the future. Not that club activities are bad, but we should think about teachers' work. I want them to move to the community for a brighter future.",13,2
"I think this is a necessary trend, but my nephew's soccer club had to spend 80,000 yen to buy a set of uniforms when he joined, and with all the talk of child poverty, I hope that sports opportunities are not taken away from children.",2,1
"Let's think about it from a student's point of view: school lets out after 3:00 p.m., and you can be active as a club member from 3:30 p.m. at your current school. If you are a high school student, you can stay active until 6:00 p.m., which is 2 hours and 30 minutes. There are about 20 club activities available at schools, so there are many options and students can easily participate. However, what do you think? When it comes to the regional transition, the majority of students usually begin to gather at the base location after 5:00 p.m. Because the leaders do not gather until 5:00 p.m. Even if we start at 5:00 p.m., it will be 7:00 p.m. in two hours. If you go home, it will be 8 pm. This will interfere with the study. First of all, there is nothing more annoying than having to go to another location. It must take courage to work among people you don't know. Not many students would be willing to go that far. It may not be enough to halve the current number of students. Many youth will stay at home. I am convinced that school activities for students will be greatly reduced and many experiences and developmental problems will occur.",14,47
"I can understand that clubs that are originally organized by a single school cannot operate due to a lack of members, but I still think that clubs should operate on a school-wide basis. If there are local clubs for baseball, soccer, swimming, etc., as an extension of lessons, I can help, but I do not agree with throwing all individual sports and liberal arts activities into the local community.",6,31
"Since teachers are not paid for the time they spend involved in club activities, it is unreasonable to hold them responsible for their management. The only way to avoid this is either to consider club activity instruction as part of their job and pay them a reasonable wage, or else not require them to be involved.",4,1
"I agree with the elimination of school-based clubs, but clubs also incur operational costs. I am opposed to a policy that only those who can afford the club fees are allowed to participate in activities, and I hope that this policy will not become a system that discourages children from doing what they want to do.",2,3
"> On the other hand, it has been pointed out that the financial burden on parents may increase due to expenses incurred that would not have been incurred if the club activities were school-based, such as fees to instructors. Since this kind of recognition was behind the tacit acceptance of the burden on teachers in the first place and was left unchecked until it became a social problem, it is nonsense to talk about the burden on parents. If club activities are to be conducted with the recognition that they are part of education, I think the only way is to have specialized instructors and subsidize them.",2,1
"I can tell you from my own experience of having my own child on an out-of-school Jr. ski team that it was very good. I had my own child on a jr. ski team outside of school and it was very good. Being outside the closed world of school made my child realize that there is a different world out there. I think this is also useful for the formation of human relationships. Especially for children who are struggling with bullying and other human relations issues, it will give them a place to escape. The junior high school also recognized it as a club activity. This was 15 years ago.",1,1
"Considering teachers' time, etc., I agree with the idea of separating club activities from the school. However, why is it necessary to have them outside the school?",1,1
"I am of the ""Ala-return"" generation. When I was in junior high school and high school, there was an atmosphere in which it was natural for boys in particular to join some kind of club activities, especially athletics, and participate in them seven times a week. It was even openly said that children who did not participate in club activities were seen as strange and that their lack of cooperation would affect their internal examinations. The actual coaching was really painful, with teachers who didn't know much about athletics, telling us not to drink water, to run, and other such gut-wrenching advice. I am hoping that things will finally get back to normal. If the children want to participate, all they have to do is pay a reasonable fee to a specialist who can give them scientific guidance. The school facilities can be rented if available, but maintenance fees should be charged. Insurance premiums should also be paid by the beneficiaries, not by the school, in case there are claims of liability in case of accidents. There is no problem for children who go home, and the school should distance itself from club activities from the standpoint of fairness.",2,1
"The Ministry of Education's stance that ""club activities are not part of the Courses of Study. The stance of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), that ""club activities are not part of the Courses of Study, and teachers are responsible for advising club activities on their own initiative,"" is making a mess of this issue. Unless the MEXT changes its ""we don't know"" attitude, there will never be a solution to this problem. Many seem to be of the opinion that it should be moved to the community, but where? What about the leaders? What about money? There is a mountain of problems that are completely unresolved, and in the end, the club activities will continue to exist ""with the goodwill of the faculty.",3,1
 ,7,2
"I agree with the elimination of club activities from schools. If you want to play a specialized sport outside of physical education, you have to pay to be taught. The same goes for cultural disciplines. That is not the role of schools or teachers, nor is it something that should be done with taxpayer money. Who in the world is going to benefit from spending taxpayers' money to get serious instruction in their favorite sport for free, and then complain if it's too tough and seek responsibility for it? It's not right to lavishly pay for a cram school and not pay for self-serving sports activities.",15,1
"If you really want to reform the work style, you should increase the number of regular teachers and reduce the number of students per class by reviewing the Courses of Study rather than transferring club activities to local communities. The most important thing is to reduce the amount of unnecessary paperwork and report writing. If possible, a flex system should be implemented so that three or more advisors can watch club activities in cooperation with the school community and the private sector, and the requirements for the allied team should be relaxed to address the shortage of club members. MISTAKE.",8,13
Club activities in schools should basically be abolished and shifted to activities in the community. We can foster a new educational industry to take on both arts and sports. This would have a positive impact on employment and the economy.,7,1
"I think schools should hire outside instructors. If leaving it to the community = no wages, it would be so-called ""exploitation of the worthiness"" and I do not think this is an appropriate response. There is a situation where the need for a neighborhood association or PTA is being called into question, so I don't think the community has enough people with that kind of extra capacity.",2,3
"As a family member of a teacher, this is a serious issue. Please separate club activities from the work of teachers. My son is now an advisor for a club he has no experience in, and he has to work every weekday and weekend without a day off. I wish I could use the time taken for club activities to prepare for classes and for my personal life. Please free the teachers who are working over the line of death from overwork from club activities.",21,3
"I guess it depends on the school. For public elementary and middle schools where students go to a certain school district, I think local guidance is fine. However, in private schools or high schools where students commute by train from multiple areas, it would be difficult to work with students from the same school, so it would be good if we could use the school as a place for activities or invite instructors.",3,1
"I think the question posed in the article is based on the premise that it will be phased in. However, I believe that club activities may be cut off suddenly at some point. TBS NEWS DIG reported on May 10 that ""As of the opening ceremony in April 2023, about 20.5% of vice principals and vice principals at elementary schools and 25.4% at junior high schools said there was a shortage of teachers"" at their place of work. We also distributed a video stating that ""the teacher shortage will become more serious as the second half of the school year progresses due to an increase in the number of teachers taking maternity/paternity leave, sick leave, and other leaves of absence. Not being able to teach classes properly is a big problem. Resolving the teacher shortage is the most urgent priority of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) listed club activities as one of the ""duties of schools that do not necessarily require teachers to take on,"" in the ""Special Subcommittee on Workplace Reform in Schools Document 2-1"" on February 8, 2008.",24,2
"Faculty. It is written as follows. On the other hand, it has been pointed out that the financial burden on parents may increase due to expenses that would not be incurred if club activities were conducted on a school basis, such as rewards for instructors. In addition, there are issues such as the inability to secure a place for activities and the lack of outside instructors who can interact with the students. ↑Here is the answer. In other words, if the teachers were allowed to do it, there would be no cost, no increase in the financial burden on parents, a place could be secured, and there were leaders (amateur advisors in name only). This is proof that the burden was on the school. It is obvious what would happen if we shifted this from the school to an outside party, and we have to get them to agree to that. I am prepared to argue with you. If you can't do something, don't do it. If the development of the sport stops, I don't care about that. Those who can spend the money should do it on their own.",43,4
"You say ""diversity education,"" but if we move club activities to the local area, won't we only be able to do activities where the leaders are close by? That's a contradiction, isn't it? It sounds like the message is that it is okay for all but the major club activities to disappear. What is the difference between outsourcing club activities on holidays and supervising club activities outside of work hours on weekdays? Don't they require the same allowances? Or should club activities only be on holidays?",5,1
I am the wife of a teacher. We don't have weekends off because of club activities on weekends as well as practices and practice games. It is very hard for my family to have children and no weekends off. So I hope that the transition will be regional and that we will have weekends off.,18,1
"Ours is a swimming club. Originally, we were mainly a club, and we only go out under the name of the school for competitions. We have an advisor, but he doesn't give us any guidance, so it's fine if the activities themselves are transferred to the local community, but...in this hot summer season, the best part was practicing in the school pool, but now the use of the pool for club activities is banned! What the heck! We can only be in there for a net of two months or so, and because there is no advisor to monitor it---you were never there in the first place! I would like to see the school facilities such as the grounds, gymnasium, music room, etc. transitioned in a way that students can use them as they are.",1,13
"When you transfer the club activities to the local area, how many people are there who have ""unquestionable character, leadership ability, and performance"" for the students and their parents? For example, if the school is a very advanced school, the school (principal) who facilitated the transfer must be responsible for the transfer if there is no guarantee of the person's character, so it is difficult to find someone... If it is an athletic club, the reality is that there are not even half of the people expected by the public who can properly instruct students in terms of exercise physiology even if the students' exercise level is low.",5,1
"I think that a community sports club format away from the school would likely result in an unmatched number of crimes. Even if it doesn't go to the level of a crime, there will be problems and students may get involved. I can't tell you how many cases I can easily imagine.",1,9
"I think it is a good idea to ""shift club activities to the community,"" but it is good for places with human resources and facilities such as urban areas, but what about rural areas where there are no human resources, no facilities, and no adult clubs or organizations? As is always the case, what the government officials (in this case, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology) think is just an empty theory on paper. About 30 years ago, I submitted a report to the then Ministry of Education proposing the use of local human resources in school club activities, and later I put it into practice at a junior high school in my area, and the junior high school went on to win a prefectural-level track and field championship. It's too late to start talking about it now without doing something about it then.",7,2
"Before we talk about transitioning club activities to the community, the school is using too many volunteers (although there will be regional differences). You should consider offering compensation for any and all volunteer activities that schools are using! And they should also reward the leaders of club activities. It is not only schools that are understaffed. And there is no one nowadays who doesn't have to work, young or old.",2,1
"According to the Ministry of Education, ""Advisor is not a job."" Therefore, there is no advisor allowance, no overtime pay on weekdays, and less than the minimum hourly wage for chaperoning on weekends, but if there is a problem, responsibility is taken and punishment is imposed. And now, about half of all bullying incidents occur within club activities? While acknowledging its effectiveness, unfortunately, club activities have become a stumbling block to school activities. Since the Ministry of Education was able to exercise its strong authority when renewing licenses, why not abolish club activities altogether with a single word from the crane? The Ministry of Education and the committee talk about ""utilizing the private sector,"" but now is the time to give club activities to the private sector and have students who want to do after-school activities pay for them, just like cram schools and swimming. Students who cannot afford to pay cannot do so, but that is inevitable in Japan's current economic system. When I think about how many working hours have been devoted to club activities for free by teachers all over the country, the current situation makes me cry something, but it's time to go to the end of the line. It's time for this industry, which is beaten to death by the public for having so many insane ones, to start having a work schedule that is as sensible as the rest of the world's.",11,1
"I think we should change the name of the club activities already. Basically, students go home after school. If people want to play soccer, they can go to this school, and if they want to play baseball, they can go to that school. So, if people want to play soccer, they can go to this school, and baseball to this school, and so on.",4,1
"If you want your child to take sports seriously, you need money and of course cooperation from the family in the absence of a coach. I think it is too selfish to say, ""I don't have time at home, I don't have money, but I want my child to play sports as much as possible, so I want him to do it at school. But if you want your child to play sports as much as possible, you are being too selfish. If you really want your child to participate in club activities, you have to be willing to be a leader for free. I think you have asked too much of the school. It's only going to get right from now on.",5,1
"It should be transferred to the community. There has been an example in Toyonaka City, Osaka, for quite some time. It's not a quick solution, though. There are many lonely seniors. (Urban areas seem strange.) ・ Excessive workload of teachers. Excessive workload of teachers. The excessive amount of work by teachers. I have talked to a temple whose ancestors ran a temple school. Work styles and local communities are changing rapidly, but education takes time to change. The Ministry of Education is not well versed in political power, and the politicians don't really understand the effects of their investment. School education has not caught up. These things are quite linked. Overall, we should focus on the community.",5,1
"If it's a brass band, they need to change the eligibility for the competition. ......... There is such a thing as a joint team in high school baseball, but preferably on an age basis like a soccer club team. Also, they need to remove the limitation of conductors to teachers, students, and alumni.",3,1
"If it's a community transition, the school doesn't have to dictate or pay for it. Instead, the children's after-school time should be considered their own. No more homework and assignments, let them complete their studies during school hours. No more club activities, so more make-up classes and assignments! I would like to see a total ban on such things.",1,4
"I am a high school teacher and from the bottom of my heart I want club activities to be eliminated. I did not become a teacher because I wanted to be involved in club activities. Without club activities, my overtime hours would be cut in half. I am considering changing jobs because I don't like club activities.",72,8
"So the regional transfer is not free, right? And the salary is 1,000 yen per hour? That's no way to make a living, and it's no way to get good instructors. I think it would be better to pay the teachers for that. I think they would take the initiative.",2,7
"I think it's a good thing - parents won't be giving money to teachers in secret anymore, there will be fewer people who want their kids to be regulars and take a skin in the game if they're not good enough, and there will be more talks that can be challenged by players representing the surrounding community, not the school unit.",4,2
"Children, parents, teachers, politicians, and various education experts will not come to a ""all sides are good"" conclusion. From the perspective of children and parents, it is natural that they would complain, ""Why should the services that I have received for free so far be cut off now, at this time, for my own child? From the administration and politicians' point of view, it is a debate they do not want to be involved in. From the teachers' point of view, they will feel that they were forced to put in the time and effort to make their personal lives miserable. However, Japan is a country with a special language, and human resources have not flowed out to other countries even in ""unfavorable working conditions."" Even the law that says ""only educational public servants are treated outside the principal's order with a fixed overtime rate of 4% even if they die of overwork"" has been in place for 50 years, which is impossible in light of international human rights standards. In the end, there are parents who do not want to lose their vested interests, politicians who do not want to change the status quo for fear of losing votes, teachers who are getting tired and quitting, and young people who understand this situation through visualization on SNS and avoid teaching. And this is before the dissolution of the organization. Nothing will move.",8,1
"Thank you, teachers, for volunteering your time until now, even on weekends, sacrificing your family and your own time. From now on, the local community will take care of the children's education free of charge. There is no one in Japan who can afford to say, ""From now on, I will take care of the children's education in my community free of charge.",13,2
"The Junior High Federation, High School Athletic Federation, Koya Federation, and XXX Federation (where XXX is the name of the sport), these organizations have a splendid hierarchical organization that permeates elementary, junior high, high school, and university schools throughout the country. The advisory teachers of the schools are in charge of collecting mysterious money called ""affiliation fees. In other cases, such as judo clubs, each athlete must pay an amount in excess of 20,000 yen in order to wear a black belt and participate in competitions. In other words, there are concessions there. In addition, teachers who can contribute to these organizations are sometimes provided with a career path. It is only natural to separate club activities from schools from the viewpoint of ensuring a healthy working environment, but the above-mentioned people will not allow it. It is a fact that, like politics in this country, the people in power who do not want to give up their vested interests are delaying the solution of all social problems. Does the Ministry of Education have the will to take a big bite out of the problem?　Impossible. They are probably stalling and watching as society's interest in the subject diminishes and club activities are reduced due to the declining birthrate.",4,1
"It's funny because the club team takes the name of the school. Since club activities are activities outside the educational curriculum, I think we should abolish all of them and start up the most as local teams. If a community cannot do that, I think they will have to give up.",22,5
"I have been involved in middle school club activities for 10 years, and I feel that when outsourcing, only the good kids are used in games because the teachers no longer supervise them. The teacher will try to use everyone who is good in the games and keep the parents and children motivated, but if it is outsourced, I feel that the less athletically gifted children will be disrespected in order to build a strong team.",1,1
"I thought it was a good idea in terms of reforming the way school teachers work, but I'm having trouble with the swim team coming to the local sports club on Saturdays and Sundays and taking over several lanes. Even for free, there are many times when they are not available for sports club schools or other programs for adults.",2,2
"Raise the salary that clubs can get! On top of that, those who want to do it can do it, and those who don't want to do it don't have to do it. That is the best. People complain because there is no guidance for club activities in the school, there is no homeroom teacher, and it happens that they enjoy themselves but get paid the same.",3,1
"I am very sick of the sense of discussing human rights violations in terms of merits and demerits. Do you consider the merits and demerits of bullying? Do you consider the merits and demerits of racial discrimination? Do you consider the merits and demerits of forced labor? There is no room for such considerations. It's all ""absolutely not"" and that's the end of it. Club activities are a human rights issue.",19,4
"I am a parent of a child who plays sports. I don't think it would be good educationally if the result is that they leave sports. School facilities should be made available for use (I think this is the most important thing). The government should pay rewards to instructors. The government should take the helm and not leave it to the local communities! If everything is going downhill as the population declines as a nation, the future of Japan is bleak.",1,2
"It is a good thing to move to the region, but how much does it cost and why are teachers now doing club activities almost for free? If there is enough money to move to the region, let's start by paying for the club activities.",9,1
"There are many people who are talking about transferring club activities to the local community, but do teachers really want to separate club activities, do communities really want to take on club activities, and do they have the ability to do so, do parents really want club activities to be transferred to the local community, do they understand the burden they place on teachers and staff, do students really want club activities to be transferred to the local community, and is it possible to satisfy all of these diverse opinions... I know it's impossible to satisfy all of them, but please don't think that teachers, communities, parents, and students only want to suck the sweet nectar that is convenient for them.",1,8
"I didn't want to join, but I had to, so I joined the junior high school next door, which has only an athletic club. It would be better if they could only do club activities that are useful for finding a job.",6,1
"School teachers work on weekends and club activities. They can't attend their own children's athletic meets, can't go out with their families, and don't get holiday pay. What kind of club activities take time away from teachers and their families? I think. Such activities are not service.",5,1
"Teachers who wish to have a deep and long-lasting relationship with the club should be given generous benefits, while if there are no voluntary teachers to carry the load, the only method would be to outsource to the private sector. The fact that they are stuck in the old way of doing things or hesitant to try new things is in itself a de facto cessation of thinking, and the children are the victims.",4,1
The situation is different in urban and non-urban areas. The situation is also different between athletic and cultural clubs. What students want to do is also different. I think the only thing we might be able to do now is to look at the stiff members of major sports in the community.,3,1
"If the school teachers are too busy, I think it would be okay to work together in the community, but I guess the situation differs from community to community.　Cooperation and rules seem to be quite difficult in today's world.",1,1
"My school is at least a 30 minute drive to the next school. Even if you do it in the community, it is almost impossible to practice together. I think it's hard to find instructors in the countryside.",1,1
I am absolutely against school club activities because it is a private sector squeeze that closes the way for retired sports people to make a living as coaches. The shortest way to improve in sports is to get the right instruction in the private sector.,1,1
"It is a period of conversion regarding regional transitions, so trial and error will be necessary. Wrong policies will emerge. Please work through the various events and make it work for your child's benefit.",2,2
"A person who is available without pay is, in essence, a slave. Teachers are not slaves, so making them take care of club activities with (almost) no overtime pay is out of line ethically and legally. Even though children are involved, the issue of teachers' human rights is also involved, and we should not let this issue drag on unnecessarily. For example, ""Starting next month, teachers will not be advisors for club activities. What would happen if we made the decision that ""If a problem occurs in a club activity without an advisor, we will seek responsibility from the parents of the student""? The parents would then immediately think seriously (in the true sense of the word) about (1) becoming their own advisor, (2) asking the parents of children in the same club, (3) hiring an outside person, (4) having their children quit the club activities, etc. And then they will realize. ""The teachers were bearing this burden for us without pay.""",3,1
"I don't think we can have a clear discussion without first making the abolition of club activities one of the considerations, even if in the extreme. It is called outside leadership, but we need to provide a well-founded compensation. Even this one thing exposes the fact that we have been correcting the free work of teachers.",6,1
"You say regional, but there are no leaders. If you pay a good salary, you should be able to ... In reality, I don't think you can make the transition to a regional. You shouldn't. That's going to be iffy. Fatalities, incidents, obscenities, who will take responsibility? Let's not do it. I think it should be the teacher.",1,5
"I wonder if there is a monthly fee for outside clubs? My daughter joined an outside rhythmic gymnastics club because there were no club activities, but there was a monthly fee, so I thought it would be nice to be able to experience sports and instruments at school for only the cost of equipment. I thought it was a good way to experience sports and musical instruments, etc. The teachers must be hard work, though. I hope there are no children who give up because of the monthly fee.",1,3
Teachers are also exhausted. We no longer have to give up anything. It is now clear which school is more necessary for survival: the school that can no longer offer classes or the school that can no longer offer club activities.,3,2
"My child goes to a private junior high school, and almost half of the students go home, and the most popular clubs are the humanities clubs such as the astronomy club, computer club, ESS, cooking, tea ceremony, and so on. In public schools, some may be forced to do club activities they don't want to do for the sake of internal exams. It is true that club activities may have been useful in preventing delinquency in the community, but in today's smartphone society, they do not play much of a role. I would like to see reform so that club activities are not linked to internal examinations. Teachers are burdened and students are burdened by club activities they do not want to do, and it is not worth it.",4,1
"I wonder what Europe and Europe and the United States are like. Since Japan has many Galapagos-like systems, I think one way is to refer to the examples of other developed countries. There are always advantages and disadvantages to reforming the system as it is now. Forced advisors for teachers is still problematic.",21,1
"This is no good. Club activities are an important part of education and a valuable place where the hearts of teachers and students can touch each other. It is a place where students learn the meaning of life through sports while sweating with each other. Club activities, one of the major pillars of a school's existence, should not be left to others.",1,11
"We have to do something about the fact that the competition is ultimately school-based, including the junior high, high school, and high school athletic federations. Especially in high schools, there is a predominance of private schools that can freely gather people around the sports clubs. I wonder what ""school club activities"" are.",4,1
"Most club activities in Japan are taxpayer-funded professional training, and it's too late to do away with them. If you're going to make a fuss about the traditions of your alma mater now, you should have done something about it before the death toll became so high that it became the norm.",4,1
"If we are going to move to the regional level, we should stop the All-Championships and the Inter-High School Championships, because the strong schools are going to gather players for these events, and some of the strong sports schools will not be able to run their schools anymore.",6,1
"I raised two children, one who was very involved in club activities and one who dropped out and went home. The one who did club activities did not do it because she wanted to, but because everyone around her was doing it. The one who went home is now more communicative and sociable. My impression is that it doesn't make much difference whether they do or don't do it.",8,2
It is important not to include club activities on the application form. The high school entrance examination should be held three times a year to allow students to retake the exam and the ratio of successful applicants should be 20% on the application form and 80% on the high school entrance examination.,3,1
"If you want to focus on sports and other extracurricular activities as a student, choose a school or community that has the right kind of activities. What you can learn through traditional club activities can be learned elsewhere. How long is Japan going to keep dragging its postwar/Showa era values?",7,1
"He is a retired high school chemistry teacher. I was the director of outdoor sports for a long time. The topic of the title, motivated by the reduction of teacher workload, seems to be leading in a different direction. Even though exhaustion in the field is such an issue, the prefectural government asks schools to submit reports that are rarely used. It is foolish to rewrite the same content into documents of different standards and send them in different ways to different submission sites. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) will scowl if a school is not designated as a research school, so they pretend that the field has raised its hand and won't stop pushing a mountain of work on them. Imagine having to fill out an order of magnitude more paperwork with a budget the size of a sparrow's tear. I do not deny that club activities are strangling teachers, even from my own experience. However, any honest homeroom teacher would feel uneasy about students engaging in high-burden activities without the teachers' knowledge. After all, the goal is not to increase the education budget. The fact that there is no mention of money at all is proof of this.",3,1
"I was an uncle who was a member of the junior high school and high school homecoming club, and as a twisted kid, I used to think it was the origin of Japanese village society when I saw the school clubs hanging out with other schools and competing with each other. The school or the local community, it is a private, voluntary activity, so we would like you to 1) sever ties with school officials, and if you want them to be involved, sign a personal employment contract as a side job, 2) pay for the use of facilities, 3) do not speak for the school, 4) do not force students and parents to make donations for expenses such as expedition fees, and 5) do not use it as a private school. However, the public should not be actively involved in and be responsible for extracurricular activities, which are called ""club activities"" in the public sector, although they are allowed to have some effect.",8,2
What's so great about club activities is that children from any family can be exposed to sports and cultural activities? I was wondering if there are any other advantages that only school clubs can offer. I wonder if there are any other advantages that are unique to school club activities ......? I don't know.,3,2
"If club activities are to remain, I think it would be better to keep them loose (light physical activity) until the end of the workday (5:00 p.m.), and students who really want to compete should join a club.",3,1
"On the one hand, this will reduce the burden on teachers and make club activities healthier, but on the other hand, if it is left to the local community, the overbearing parents will probably become depressed in various ways. And the distorted relationship between students and overbearing parents will distort club activities. Even now, they are club activities, right? Parents who want to be involved in the club activities will interfere with the activities, such as taking out cars and cheering for the students. Are these club activities for the students? Or is it for the parents? Is that the way to make the children independent? That's what I'm talking about. They can go by train, bus, on foot, or by bicycle, and they can go to practices and games by themselves. If you leave it to the community, it is essential to have an agreement that the students' parents (related parties) will never interfere or let them get involved!",3,1
"Club activities in a place called school, where people gather. Because they are gathered together, they can do what they can do. Teachers support them. It's not a job, it's a support activity. Supporting, almost volunteer.",1,3
"Japanese people's desire, obsession, and dependence on extracurricular activities are already in the abnormal realm. After-school activities for children are the responsibility of their parents. Who wants to be a school teacher? Parents who depend on schools don't want to be teachers, do they? Some people say that if you don't want to be a teacher, don't be a teacher, but that is really true now, and Japan's future is in danger because there are not enough people. Human resources are not inexhaustible.",21,1
"Are you free to do or not do school club activities? I would prefer to transition. There weren't any club activities that I wanted to do, so there would be more variety in the clubs that are done in the city and other communities.",2,1
"The local government in the Curry incident said they were going to eliminate club activities, but last year there was no budget for an outside instructor, and they will continue to do so next year. The local government in the Curry incident said they were going to eliminate club activities, but they had no budget for outside instructors last year. If there is no budget, why don't they just eliminate all club activities at once? It can be done in phases over a few years, just give notice in 2024 that the club activity program will end by 2026. Just tell them to go to local clubs or lessons. And the club activity relationship trouble rate is high, and parents make trivial complaints about free club activities. Club activities are a cancer. The school board only looks good to the parents, so people have left the field. My wife, who works nonstop with students until regular hours without a break, is insane.",3,1
"It is necessary to reduce teacher labor, but there are many problems. If you pay for a professional instructor to come in, fine, but if it is done by an old guy nearby or a parent, I am against it. It is not a question of knowledge of club activities, but if people who are not trained to lead others start doing it, it will definitely become like a Showa-era sporadic sport, lose their temper, and become reckless. If that happens, the harmony of the community will be disturbed. Hire professionals, it's part of raising children, that's what taxpayers should spend their money on!",1,2
"I'm on the community side, but I can't do it if I'm forced to and asked to take care of both weekends. I have my own private life. I would welcome it if you set up a system to take care of that as well.",1,3
"Impossible. Clarify where the responsibility lies, pay them overtime, and do it. If you can't do that, you have to dismantle the club activities. Only club activities can operate at such a low cost. The most frightening thing is not the guarantee of money but the question of responsibility. If there is any trouble, the general leaders will surely back out.",8,1
Just getting teachers and students back to human life from overdone club activities would be effective. It is just a shame that what minor club activities have taken over may be lost.,1,3
"School club activities based on teachers working for free and community clubs based on parents' expense. From the viewpoint of beneficiary-pays, I think the latter is correct.",11,1
Wouldn't a regional transition of learning be more realistic? Athletic teams need grounds and gymnasiums. Schools have all these facilities. I think it would be more realistic to have the students study at a local cram school.,3,23
"To be honest, it is going to be a difficult time for parents and children who are aiming for internal scores in club activities. We can no longer talk about club activities. I have a feeling that the era of academic achievement is coming.",3,2
"Think about it. Sports, literature, singing, dancing, and music, if they are not livelihoods, are just the pastimes of the rich. Isn't it strange that in a society where there are differences in the economic power of parents, students are equally obliged to do them?",13,3
"As a parent, there is a transportation problem. Instructors are also hard to find who are available on weekday evenings. Away from the school, there will be a certain amount of problems.",1,3
"If we let the advisors do everything, they complain that we work too hard. If we introduce instructors, they complain that they can't educate the students. Has the world always been this picky?",12,2
"The reason why he is saying this is because he feels that ""if you are a teacher, you can work for free, even on your days off, for a small fee. I hope you will stop making fun of teachers.",11,1
"Enjoyable club activities should involve the community and elementary and junior high schools. It could be a way to revitalize the community. Private schools and some public schools should aim higher. (Not all schools in the country should be involved, but each school should have its own characteristics.",1,1
I think that many of the local clubs that charge fees are quite poorly run. I think there will be more trouble then.,1,2
"I am a middle school teacher and have been a basketball advisor for 20 years. I've been told that there are not enough financial resources to transition to the regional level, but then what happens to the teachers who are currently forced to do unfair labor with insufficient financial resources?",4,1
"Faculty. I really don't understand why I have to spend after school and weekends with activities that I have no interest in. It's not a job. What we do in club activities is a ""hobby. A ""hobby. Why should I be forced to do it during work hours? Why do I have to go along with ballet, drama, track and field, brass band, etc.? Seriously, I can't do it.",12,1
"It sounds good, but up until now, the club has been run by the exquisite tinkering of the club's advisors. I do not believe that the local leaders have the know-how to do so. The local community does not have the ability to make club activities more fulfilling than they have been up to now.",1,5
"Club activities should be abolished once and rebuilt in the community. If more teachers and staff are on leave, bullying will not be prevented.",3,1
"It was just an exploitation of motivation to the teachers. If you want to continue club activities, the first thing you need to do is to provide after-school and Sunday work allowances. Or, you can use the money to bring in coaches and managers from outside the school. If you are unwilling to pay for these things, you should quit club activities.",8,1
"I think 20+ years ago, the allowance for high school teachers to engage in club activities was 150 yen per day. Without providing a specific amount, I think this is just a fluffy argument.",1,1
I think checks are necessary to ensure that there is no excessive coaching such as power harassment or violence in order to gain prestige as a leader.,2,1
"This is not the time to think about disadvantages. Why are we talking about this? Do you understand that point? First of all, we need to save the teachers who are crumbling at the helm.",46,2
"They deployed a new person to a sport he had no experience in because it was his experience, and he was the main advisor. The students said that the club had become weak, and the parents said that the club could not win because of poor teaching methods and injuries. Furthermore, after club activities were over, he had to make teaching materials, grade papers, and prepare administrative materials. Is that the norm?",6,2
"If you're forced to do club activities you don't want to do, whether it's on campus or in the community, it doesn't make much difference. As someone who has experienced that what I wanted to do was not an option in the first place.",4,1
"There is no denying that the officials of the Sports Agency and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology have made hasty decisions based only on their own ideals and theories. They only make decisions and leave the implementation and budget to the local communities and schools.",3,1
"Reform has not progressed at all. Nothing has changed. And there is no atmosphere of change, only challenges. It is an unassailable problem. Solve this problem quickly!",2,1
I think it is a good thing. It will help build community and the burden on the teachers will have to be taken care of.,2,2
"I know that students leave school around 3:30 to 4:00 or before. If it is not your school, how will you travel from there?",5,1
"There are more than a few people who became teachers because they wanted to be involved in club activities, and I want you to know that there are voices like that.",1,5
"School club activities have been thrown into the self-sacrifice of teachers and forced to work for free. Before talking about the cost, they should pay the price.",1,1
"Why not greatly increase the budget and hire someone to instruct only club activities from after school? The cost would come from public funds, as it is a public education. How impossible!",5,2
"We can come up with any number of reasons why we can't do it. Society will never progress that way. Since there are challenges, we should actively embrace change. There is no progress without reform.",4,1
"The more rural the area, the more restrictive it is, so there is virtually no merit to the article. The more the countryside is restricted, the more the benefits of the article are virtually nonexistent.",6,1
Hiring instructors for club activities from the private sector will only eventually lead to blackouts if they are used for a low gratuity. There would be no one left to take on the job. The Ministry of Education is very naive.,9,2
"That's fine. The playground was taken over by baseball and soccer was kicked out. If it becomes a community, it could be put to good use.",3,1
"Pros. I would like teachers to concentrate on ""improving students' academic performance"" and ""eliminating bullying"", leaving club activities, etc. to the community.",8,4
Eliminating competitions and contests would reduce club activities. Who will manage outside instructors? Will they take care of the wrangling between students? Or is that the job of the parents?,9,2
Overzealous people always bring trouble. Some parents even interfere with the coaching of the advisors. Why don't you just pay to go to a strong sports club?,12,1
"If club activities are to be separated from schools, club activities should be removed from the recommendation requirements for high school and college entrance examinations.",2,1
"Regional transition is fine, but the current system does not allow participation in various tournaments, etc. without the principal's permission. How do we create a system that leads to the general assembly, inter-high school, etc.? Will each tournament disappear?",1,1
"Weekends off. One hour on weekdays is enough. For students who want to do more than that, they can join a sports club like a cram school, or a cultural club, or a brass band, etc.",9,1
"It is so slow to say the least. As long as club activities are attached to schools, the long working hours of teachers will never be corrected. This is the starting point.",44,8
"I think there are very few ""adults who are free at 4 p.m., who excel in sports skills and theory, and who have a decent personality.",10,1
"If the teachers' workload is reduced, then reduce their salaries and use that as a source of funds to pay the instructors.",3,3
"Even if you externalize, the responsibility will eventually fall on the teacher, and there is no one who can take on the additional responsibility for free that calls for detachment.",11,1
"Parents who don't pay a penny to teachers who are willing to work overtime at school club activities, but then yell at them that their children's lack of progress is the fault of the instructors. I can't take it anymore. I can't take any more of this. I want to go to a social sports club or private school.",7,1
"Club activities will be shifted to the community. Problems that occur there, such as disputes and student guidance, will not be brought to the school.",3,1
Some say that the cost of the program is a burden... but please remember that the work of the program is paid for by the service of the faculty.,3,1
It is the only way to allow teachers to focus on their primary job. I think this is the only way for teachers to focus on their work and not on their students as a stress reliever.,2,1
"Our teachers, Kinpachi-sensei and Ryunosuke Tokugawa, certainly had their hands full teaching homeroom. They didn't have time to teach club activities, I guess. But, did the rugby teacher do both?",1,1
"Let's abolish club activities. In the past, it was half-mandatory, as if you had to join club activities, but times are different.",5,2
"Where are the leaders? Aren't there only power-hungry, moralistic old men who have retired from their jobs? And especially in the countryside, where are the places of activity and how do they get to the places of activity?",5,6
"Times are changing, but what is not changing is Japanese education! Club activities, homework, school backpacks... are no longer necessary, children are not mass-produced goods, and Japanese people without diversity will just perish!",2,2
"I think it would be a good idea to hire a teacher who specializes in club activities, even if it is a regional transition. No classes (or short time), only club activities.",3,1
"From the students' point of view, club activities were compulsory. In our junior high school, students gathered around sports that seemed easy, and it was unhealthy.",1,1
Please make sure to pay the teachers who are watching the club's activities after hours on weekdays and on weekends.,1,1
I am concerned that it will not be a club business. It is likely to be uprooted by special treatment to private schools with connections.,1,1
"What are club activities for? Forced membership, I didn't like that. I mean, if you want to go pro, or if you just want to, that's fine.",6,1
We do not know what it should be. Let's let everyone in society figure it out! Let's take it out of the school's jurisdiction for once!,5,1
"Thanks to the monster, we are finally commissioned. Schools are saved. Children are free and good.",2,1
"If they want to be smart, they go to cram school for their studies. If they want to play sports, they go to a local club that charges a fee. If they want to be smart, they can go to a cram school for their studies.",4,2
I thought the purpose of TOTO and Lotto 6 was to raise funds for such occasions? Sorry if I'm wrong.,3,1
"There was a candidate in the city council election in our city who said something like ""bring club activities back to the schools""....",1,3
I feel it is good for people who want a place to stay outside of school. It would reduce suicides.,3,2
"When you leave school, you are not in the club, right? What are they going to do during games, tournaments, etc.?",3,3
"Not only club activities, but also lunch, going to and from school, and more should be transitioned.",3,1
It is difficult to secure outside leadership in rural areas.,2,2
You'd better slide quickly into the community from where you can.,2,1
I am sure that a group under the Ministry of Education will be formed and that it will be in charge of the club activities.,5,1
"I was going to school for club activities, I might not go to school...",2,1
Wouldn't paying the teacher overtime solve everything?,2,4
"When people move, it costs money. I think it's only natural.",3,1
Please stop students from being able to participate in club activities.,1,4
Club activities are not the teacher's job.,4,2
What if no one else in the community is doing it?,4,2
Abolish club activities and PTA -> dismantle,7,1
Forcing club activities is not a good idea in the first place.,6,1
Lose the homework before moving to the community.,4,2
The times were turning.,2,1
"I think we should proceed, but we will not proceed because the government will not pay for it. We cannot transition to a club activity area by just talking and not doing anything.",5,2
"I'm a former teacher. I can assure you that the club has no problem with one of the regional transition options! No other option exists in the first place. There are some idiots who say things like ""don't take away the children's potential"" or ""the students have a future,"" but if that's the case, you should take charge of it! If you can't do it, then don't interfere from the beginning. Teachers are not required to be involved because it is a non-educational category and there is no need for them to look at it. If you want to be involved in club activities, you can pay to join a local club or society! If you can't do that, you can do it by raising funds for a club, or by getting a part time job and going to a club! Don't get it wrong! Don't spoil your parents either!",15,2
"A middle school teacher reports from the field. Club activities are a cancer. If it is not cut immediately, the school will die. It is the biggest contributor to free overtime on weekdays, which can occur for as long as 2 hours and 30 minutes in crazy schools that run until 6pm. Holiday pay is $3,600 in our area. It's below minimum wage, there is no transportation except for limited official games, and it's common to be tied up for 12 hours and stay behind for less than 1000 yen. The situation is completely ridiculous, as the workers are treated as if they are doing this as a hobby, and if something happens, they are held accountable. This is crazy because they are forced to compete in a sport in which they have no experience or interest. Young people cannot say no or express their opinions, and they are suddenly stuck as the main advisor with a coach and referee at the end of April, and even the assistant advisor is being pushed around by the insane behavior of the ""enthusiastic"" main advisor, which is miserable itself. The game schedule is also insane and stupid, with consecutive Saturdays and Sundays, and GW being disrupted. Please do as you please at the beneficiary's expense.",18,2
"You shouldn't be taking up Yahoo commenters or anything like that. Don't you know the low level of human attributes of the Yahoo commenters to begin with? Dissatisfaction with life, unfulfilled days, stress that cannot be dissipated, lightweight typists. It's a cesspool. Taking up a flimsy argument that is right on the screen, but without the life experience and persuasiveness to deserve that argument, is OK for fun, but out of work. The world would be hell and scum if it listened to these sorry people. Congratulations to you, and I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.",1,6
"The choice is self-evident: to put up with the reduction in the number of teachers and go with what we have, or to separate and leave the clubs to the community. And yet, any public school board that chooses the former should feel free to perish.",2,1
"Until now, school club activities have been conducted by amateurs with no experience in athletic competitions, using unintelligible training methods they learned from comic books, so they get seriously injured and don't improve.",10,2
I would like to see additional tax collection for tax evading leaders who collect high monthly fees under the guise of volunteerism and have their parents instruct them.,3,1
"To continue to burden the teaching staff with crooked personalities and low ability is only going to lead to a mountain of injuries, etc. Change it now!",2,4
